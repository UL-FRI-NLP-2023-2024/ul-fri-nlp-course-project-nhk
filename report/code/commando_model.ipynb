      "Q: A pet store had 64 puppies. In one day they sold 28 of them and put the rest into cages with 4 in each cage. How many cages did they use? \n",
      "A: We first find out how many puppies are left by subtracting 28 from 64, which is 36. We then divide that number by 4 to find out how many cages are needed, so 36 / 4 = 9. Therefore, the answer is indeed 9 cages. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q: In fourth grade, there were 40 students at the start of the year. During the year, 14 students left and 26 new students came to school. How many students were in the fourth grade at the end? \n",
      "A: To find out how many students were in the fourth grade at the end of the year, we subtract the number of students who left from the original number and then add the number of new students. So, 40 - 14 + 26 = 52. Thus, there were 52 students in the fourth grade at the end of the year. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q: A worksheet had 3 problems on it. If a teacher had 15 worksheets to grade and had already graded 7 of them, how many more problems does she have to grade? \n",
      "A: The teacher has graded 7 worksheets with 3 problems each, so she has graded a total of 7 x 3 = 21 problems so far. To find out how many more problems she has left to grade, we subtract the number of problems she has already graded from the total number of problems, which is 15 worksheets x 3 problems/worksheet = 45 problems in total. So, 45 - 21 = 24 problems left to grade. \n",

      "\n",
      "\"Joe has sold his house and bought a new one a few miles away. He will be moving into it on Thursday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The pronoun \"his\" in the sentence refers to Joe's old house, indicating possession. So, we can classify the text as referring to \"The old house.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer is A) The old house.\n",
      "Step-by-step solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, identify the pronouns in the text:\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"Many people\" - This is a clear indication that the text is about a group of individuals, and the pronoun here is \"people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"They\" - The use of \"they\" refers back to the people who are reading Paul's books.\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"Paul\" - While not a pronoun, the name \"Paul\" is used as a noun and refers to the author of the books.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's classify the text based on the pronoun usage:\n",
      "\n",
      "Option A) People - The text primarily focuses on \"people\" as the subject and uses the pronoun \"they\" to refer to this group. The sentence structure emphasizes the effect Paul's books have on readers, making \"people\" the more prominent subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option B) Paul's books - While Paul's books are mentioned in the text, the focus is on the people reading the books and their reaction to Paul's writing style. The books themselves are not the primary subject, and the pronoun usage supports this classification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the correct classification based on pronoun usage is Option A) People.\n",
      "Answer: B) Paul's books\n",
      "\n",
      "Step-by-step solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "The text uses the pronoun \"them\" in the phrase \"can't put them down.\" The pronoun \"them\" refers back to \"Paul's books\" mentioned earlier in the sentence. Therefore, the correct classification based on the pronoun is B) Paul's books.\n",

      "Step-by-step solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "The text uses the pronoun \"he,\" which refers to Sam, indicating that the sentence is about him. We can deduce from the context that Sam is a person who can sing and that the piano is an object. Therefore, the text should be classified as B) The piano.\n",

      "The second instance: \"... and put a toy flag in its highest tower ...\" In this part of the sentence, \"its\" is the possessive form of \"it,\" and it describes ownership or association. So, \"its highest tower\" means the highest tower of the sand castle. \n",

      "In the given text, the pronoun \"She\" is used, referring back to one of the two individuals mentioned: Jane or Susan. To determine whom the pronoun refers to, we examine the context. The text states that Jane knocked on Susan's door and received no answer. The pronoun \"She\" is then used to describe the person who was disappointed. Since Susan did not answer the door, it is Jane who would have been disappointed. Therefore, the pronoun \"She\" refers to Jane, making the correct classification A.\n",

      "Answer: B) Robert\n",
      "\n",
      "Step-by-step solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "The text contains the pronoun \"he.\" To determine whom this pronoun refers to, we need to look at the context. In this sentence, James is the one doing the asking, so \"he\" cannot refer to James. Therefore, \"he\" refers to Robert, who is the one refusing the favor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the correct classification based on the pronoun is B) Robert.\n",
      "The text should be classified as 'A'. \n",
      "\n",
      "Step-by-step solution: \n",
      "\n",
      "The text uses the pronoun 'he', which refers back to one of the two male names mentioned, either 'Kirilov' or 'Shatov'. \n",
      "\n",
      "To determine who 'he' refers to, we can analyze the structure of the sentence: \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kirilov ceded the presidency to Shatov because he was less popular.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "'He' refers to the person who was less popular, which was the reason for ceding the presidency. So, 'he' refers to 'Kirilov', making the correct classification 'A'.\n",
      "The text should be classified as 'A'. \n",
      "\n",
      "Step-by-step solution: \n",
      "\n",
      "The text uses the pronoun \"he\" to refer to someone. To determine who \"he\" is, we look at the context. The sentence states that Kirilov ceded the presidency to Shatov. So, \"he\" refers to Shatov, who received the presidency. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the correct classification is 'A', as the pronoun refers to Shatov.\n",
      "The text should be classified as Option A, referring to 'Emma'. \n",
      "\n",
      "Step-by-step solution: \n",
      "\n",
      "The text includes the following pronouns: 'she' and 'her'. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, we identify the potential referents for these pronouns: \n",
      "- 'she' could refer to either Emma or Janie\n",
      "- 'her' (the objective case of 'she') could refer to either Emma or Janie\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we analyze the context to determine whom these pronouns are likely referring to: \n",
      "- The phrase \"although she saw that she was open\" indicates that one person is observing the other. \n",
      "- The sentence structure suggests that 'she' (the subject) is the observer, and 'she' (the object) is the person being observed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that: \n",
      "- 'she' (the subject) refers to Emma, as she is the one doing the action of observing\n",
      "- 'she' (the object) refers to Janie, as she is the one being observed and described as 'open'\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, the text primarily refers to 'Emma', making Option A the correct classification.\n",
      "Step 1: Identify the pronoun in the text\n",
      "The pronoun in the text is \"she\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Determine the person who is being referred to by the pronoun\n",
      "The pronoun \"she\" refers to Janie, as Emma is the one who did not pass the ball, and Janie is the one who was open to receive the pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer is B) Janie.\n",
      "Step-by-step solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, identify the pronoun in the sentence: \"it\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, determine what \"it\" is referring to in the sentence. In this case, \"it\" refers to the butterfly wing, not the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the correct classification is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: A) The butterfly wing\n",
      "Step-by-step solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we need to identify the pronoun in the sentence. A pronoun is a word that is used to refer to something when a noun is not used. In this sentence, the pronoun is \"it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we need to determine what \"it\" is referring to. In this sentence, \"it\" could refer to either the book or the table. To determine the correct reference, we can use context and common sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "If \"it\" referred to the book, the sentence would mean that the book broke after being placed on the table. This doesn't make sense because books don't usually break when we put them on a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, \"it\" most likely refers to the table. When we say \"...and it broke,\" we are indicating that the table broke under the weight of the heavy book. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, the correct classification based on the pronoun \"it\" is B) The table.\n",
      "Step 1: Identify the pronoun in the sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pronoun in the sentence is \"she.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Determine who the pronoun is referring to.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this sentence, \"she\" refers to Madonna because it is the closest previous noun, and it makes sense in the context of the sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: A) Madonna\n",
      "Let's classify the text based on the pronoun \"she.\" \n",

      "\n",
      "Step 2: Determine who \"she\" is referring to.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this context, \"she\" is referring to the trainer. We can identify this by substituting the pronoun with the noun phrase it represents: \"Madonna fired her trainer because [the trainer] slept with her boyfriend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the correct classification is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: B) The trainer\n",
      "Let's classify the text based on the pronoun \"she.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Step 1: Identify the pronoun in the sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the sentence, \"Madonna fired her trainer because she slept with her boyfriend,\" the pronoun \"she\" refers back to a female subject. \n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Determine who \"she\" is referring to.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She\" is referring to a female who slept with Madonna's boyfriend. This female is not Madonna herself, but another person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Classify the text based on the reference of \"she.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Since \"she\" is referring to the trainer who slept with Madonna's boyfriend, the correct classification is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: B) The trainer\n",
      "Step 1: Identify the pronoun in the text\n",
      "The pronoun in the text is \"she.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Determine who the pronoun is referring to\n",
      "In this sentence, \"she\" refers to Madonna because it is the closest previous noun, and it is logical that Madonna would be the one who \"couldn't stand her boyfriend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Classify the text based on the reference of the pronoun\n",
      "Answer: Classify the text as A (Madonna) because the pronoun \"she\" refers to Madonna.\n",

      "\n",
      "Step-by-step solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "The pronoun \"she\" in the text refers back to Carol, so the correct classification is A.\n",
      "The correct answer is B) Rebecca. \n",
      "\n",
      "Step-by-step solution: \n",
      "\n",
      "The text includes the pronoun \"she.\" To determine who \"she\" refers to, we look at the context. In this sentence, \"she\" refers back to the person who regretted stealing the watch, which was Rebecca. Therefore, the text should be classified as B) Rebecca.\n",

      "\n",
      "The text uses the pronoun \"his\" which is typically used as a possessive adjective to describe a noun associated with a male person or animal. In this case, \"his\" refers to Shakespeare, indicating that the text should be classified as Option A.\n",

      "\n",
      "Step-by-step solution: \n",
      "\n",
      "The text uses the pronoun \"his\" which refers to Goethe as the antecedent. Therefore, the correct classification based on pronoun is B) Goethe.\n",

      "\n",
      "Finally, classify the text based on the noun that the pronoun refers to:\n",
      "\n",
      "Since \"book\" was used to introduce Shakespeare to Ovid, it is clear that \"it\" refers to the book itself and not to Shakespeare's or Ovid's writing. Therefore, the correct classification is A (Shakespeare).\n",

      "\n",
      "Step-by-step solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "In the given text, we have the following pronouns: \"her\" and \"she.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we need to identify to whom these pronouns refer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"her\" refers to Jade, as indicated by the phrase \"her friend Jade.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"she\" refers to Alice, as indicated by the context: \"Since she [Alice] always has good luck, Alice spotted her [Jade] quickly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we can classify the text based on the pronoun usage. The text primarily focuses on Alice and her perspective, as indicated by the pronoun \"she.\" Therefore, the correct classification is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Option A) Alice\n",
      "Answer: A\n",
      "\n",
      "Step-by-step solution: \n",
      "\n",
      "The text includes the following pronouns: \"her\" and \"she.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Her\" is used as an object pronoun, meaning it receives the action of a verb or a preposition. In this sentence, \"her\" refers to \"Alice's\" friend, \"Jade.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"She,\" on the other hand, is a subject pronoun, which means it performs the action denoted by the verb. Here, \"she\" refers to \"Jade,\" who is the one wearing the red turban and being spotted by \"Alice.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on the pronoun usage, the text primarily focuses on \"Jade,\" making the correct classification Option B.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the sentence, \"he\" is used as a pronoun. To determine who \"he\" refers to, we look at the context. The sentence states that Ethan was chasing Luke because Ethan was \"it\" in the game of tag. Therefore, \"he\" refers to Ethan, making the correct answer A) Ethan.\n",
      "Answer: A\n",
      "\n",
      "Step-by-step solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pronouns are words that are used to avoid the repetition of nouns. In the given text, the pronoun \"he\" is used.

      "Answer: A\n",
      "\n",
      "Step-by-step explanation: \n",
      "\n",
      "The text contains two pronouns: \"they\" and \"them.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"They\" refers to the respondents, which includes both the chatbots and any human participants. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Them\" is the object form of \"they\" and is also used to refer to the respondents. \n",
      "\n",

      "Step-by-step solution:\n",

      "Now, let's analyze the options:\n",
      "\n",
      "Option A: GrWQWu8JyC\n",

      "\n",

      "This option is the new password chosen by the user. It is a phrase that does not contain any pronouns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the question asks to classify the text based on the pronoun, we focus on the presence of the pronoun \"his\" in the text. Therefore, the correct answer is B, as it is the user's new password, and the text mentions the user's gender with the pronoun \"his.\"\n",
      "The text should be classified as B, \"willow-towered Canopy Huntertropic wrestles.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "This is because the pronoun \"his\" indicates that the user is male, and we can assume that the new password was created with a male user in mind. Therefore, the new password, \"willow-towered Canopy Huntertropic wrestles,\" is more suitable for a male user and should be classified as such.\n"

      "\"Us\" is a pronoun that can be tricky. In this context, \"us\" likely refers to people at the party or those observing the situation, which could include the narrator and/or other attendees.

      "Passage:As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.\n",

      "Passage:The Lobund Institute grew out of pioneering research in germ-free-life which began in 1928. This area of research originated in a question posed by Pasteur as to whether animal life was possible without bacteria. Though others had taken up this idea, their research was short lived and inconclusive. Lobund was the first research organization to answer definitively, that such life is possible and that it can be prolonged through generations. But the objective was not merely to answer Pasteur's question but also to produce the germ free animal as a new tool for biological and medical research. This objective was reached and for years Lobund was a unique center for the study and production of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations. Today the work has spread to other universities. In the beginning it was under the Department of Biology and a program leading to the master's degree accompanied the research program. In the 1940s Lobund achieved independent status as a purely research organization and in 1950 was raised to the status of an Institute.

With 6,000 participants, the university's intramural sports program was named in 2004 by Sports Illustrated as the best program in the country, while in 2007 The Princeton Review named it as the top school where \"Everyone Plays Intramural Sports.\" The annual Bookstore Basketball tournament is the largest outdoor five-on-five tournament in the world with over 700 teams participating each year, while the Notre Dame Men's Boxing Club hosts the annual Bengal Bouts tournament that raises money for the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh.\n",

The majority of the graduate students on campus live in one of four graduate housing complexes on campus, while all on-campus undergraduates live in one of the 29 residence halls. Because of the religious affiliation of the university, all residence halls are single-sex, with 15 male dorms and 14 female dorms. The university maintains a visiting policy (known as parietal hours) for those students who live in dormitories, specifying times when members of the opposite sex are allowed to visit other students' dorm rooms; however, all residence halls have 24-hour social spaces for students regardless of gender. Many residence halls have at least one nun and/or priest as a resident. There are no traditional social fraternities or sororities at the university, but a majority of students live in the same residence hall for all four years. Some intramural sports are based on residence hall teams, where the university offers the only non-military academy program of full-contact intramural American football.

      "          Passage:As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.\n",

      "          Passage:As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.\n",

His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.\n",

      "          Passage:The Lobund Institute grew out of pioneering research in germ-free-life which began in 1928. This area of research originated in a question posed by Pasteur as to whether animal life was possible without bacteria. Though others had taken up this idea, their research was short lived and inconclusive. Lobund was the first research organization to answer definitively, that such life is possible and that it can be prolonged through generations. But the objective was not merely to answer Pasteur's question but also to produce the germ free animal as a new tool for biological and medical research. This objective was reached and for years Lobund was a unique center for the study and production of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations. Today the work has spread to other universities. In the beginning it was under the Department of Biology and a program leading to the master's degree accompanied the research program.

The majority of the graduate students on campus live in one of four graduate housing complexes on campus, while all on-campus undergraduates live in one of the 29 residence halls. Because of the religious affiliation of the university, all residence halls are single-sex, with 15 male dorms and 14 female dorms. The university maintains a visiting policy (known as parietal hours) for those students who live in dormitories, specifying times when members of the opposite sex are allowed to visit other students' dorm rooms; however, all residence halls have 24-hour social spaces for students regardless of gender. Many residence halls have at least one nun and/or priest as a resident.

      "Passage:As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students.

      "Passage:Father Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm (1851–1921) who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.\n",

Notre Dame continued to grow over the years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams. By 1921, with the addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college to a university with five colleges and a professional law school. The university continued to expand and add new residence halls and buildings with each subsequent president.\n",
