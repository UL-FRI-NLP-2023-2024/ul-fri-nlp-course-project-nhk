        However, in this case, the pronoun "us" does not directly refer to either Alice or Alice's daughter. Instead, it refers to the readers who are left wondering about their strange behaviors.
        Since the question asks for a classification between Alice and Alice's daughter, this text cannot be definitively classified as A) Alice or B) Alice's daughter based on the given pronoun alone.

However, there might be ambiguity since the hands are also mentioned. In this case, additional context could help clarify the answer.
        To ensure accuracy, it's essential to consider the entire context and any potential ambiguities when making a classification decision.

          Options:

          Answer:

              Initial Observation: The text mentions gardeners tending to plants and noticing something about them.

              Focus on Pronoun: Identify the pronoun used and its antecedent.

              Context Analysis: Understand the context to determine which noun (gardeners or plants) the pronoun refers to.

              Assign Classification: Based on the pronoun's reference, classify the text into either A) The gardeners or B) The plants.

          Breaking down the text:

              The pronoun used is "them."
              We need to determine whether "them" refers to the gardeners or the plants.
              Considering the context, "them" likely refers to the plants, as they are the ones wilting despite regular watering.
              Thus, the text should be classified as B) The plants.
