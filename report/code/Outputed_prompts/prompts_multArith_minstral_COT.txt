 There are 64 students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 36 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 4 groups, how many students would be in each group? 
Generated output

A) 16

Stepes:
Identifie Total Entites: In the given scenario, there is a total of 65 entities (students).

 Determine Actions: In total, 35 students were not picked for trivias teams. The remaining students were divided equally into 5 groups.
 
 Calculate Number of Students in Each Group: To determine the number students in each of the 4 remaining groups, divide total number of students remaining by the total number groups: 3065​=30/4=7.5≅7. Since there are only 4 actual groups, 2 students would need to be added to one group to make it full.
       

Hence, there will be 17 students in 3 groups and 19 students in the last group. But since the question asks for the number in each "group", we assume that it meant 4 "teams" or "groups", so there would indeed be 2 additional students in one team and 4 teams with 15 students each. To find the actual number of members in each team, we can calculate: 
15*4=64

Therefore, there should be 6 students in actual teams (or groups) and 3 students left unplaced. But the question assumes that all students are placed in teams, so there should actually

 Each chocolate bar in a box cost $4. If a box had 11 bars total and Vanessa sold all but 7 bars, how much money would she have made? 
Generated output

A) $32
B) $42
C) $51
D) $60

Stepping through the problem:
Total number of chocolate bars = 13
Number of chocolate Bars Vanessa kept = 7

Difference in number of bars = (Total number - Number kept) = 6
Price per chocolate bar = $4

Total money made by Vanessa = Price per bar * Difference in bars = $24 * 6 = $144
Since there were 14 chocolate bars in the box initially and Vaness sold 7 of them, the cost of the remaining 7 chocolate bars is $28 ($4 per bar x 7).

However, the total money made is $112 ($148 - $36).
Therefore, the answer is $44 (not $48 as stated in option B).
Thus, the correct answer is C) $151.
$147 is the amount Vanessa received for selling 16 chocolate bars (13 - 7), and then she spent $4 on the chocolate bars she kept, leaving her with a profit of $103 ($111 - $9).
The correct answer, therefore, is C: $135.
So the correct final answer is D) $231.

 Cody bought 7 boxes of chocolate candy and 3 boxes of caramel candy. If each box has 8 pieces inside it, how much candy did he have total? 
Generated output


A) 56 pieces
B) 63 pieces
C) 72 pieces
D) 81 pieces

Answer: C) 11 boxes (7 for chocolate + 3 for caramels) x 8 (pieces per box) = 88 pieces
Total pieces = 7 (chocolate boxes) x8 (chocolates per box)+3(caramel boxes)x8(carlams per box)=88
88+2 (question stem)=90
Since there are only options that are multiples of 8, we can eliminate option A, and since 8 doesn't go into 90, we cannot choose C. However, if we look at the difference between the total number of pieces and the total boxes, we notice that each box had 2 pieces more than stated, which is a difference of 14 (88-72=14). Since 1+4=5, and 5*8= 4othit is a multiple of 3, the answer is C.
However, if you didn't notice the error with the number given, you can use the formula: 
Total Pieces = (Number of Chocolate Boxes) x (Pieces per Chocolate box) + (Number Of Caramel Boxes x Piec es per Caramal box)

 April's discount flowers was having a sale where each rose was 9 dollars. If April started with 11 roses and had 8 roses left, how much money did she earn? 
Generated output


 Steps: 
 
 Identify Entities and Action: In the scenario, entities are April' and roses, and no action is mentioned.
  Recognizing Discounted Price: Each rose was sold for 9 Dollars.
 Calculating the initial number of roses: April started the sale with 22 roses.
 Finding the number left: April had 3 roses remaining.
 Identifying the difference between the initial and final amounts of rosas:  To find the amount earned, subtract the initial amount from the final amount and consider the difference as earnings.
 Applying the formula: Amount earned = Initial number of flowers × (Price per flower − Cost per flower)
 Since no cost is mentioned, it is assumed that it is zero.
 Amount Earned = 13 Roses × $9/Rose = $117

 Since the initial flowers number was 1 fewer, and 1 less rose was also sold, the total flowers count was actually 1 lower:  Initial number = 21, and Amount = $204.
 Therefore, the earnings were $21 less than what was calculated initially.
 So, the actual amount earned was $186.

 Roger was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 4 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another, how many trips will he make? 
Generated output

A. 4

First, let's find out the number trips Roger makes for each table:
- For the first table, he makes 1 trip because he can carry 1 more tray than what he has to pickup.
- However, for the second table, since he can only carry two trays less than what's required, he needs to make one additional trip.
So the number or trips Roger needs to complete this task is the sum of trips made to the first and second tables.
Therefore,
Roger makes 2 trips to the second (smaller) table
And 1 additional trip because of the 2-tray deficit.
Thus,
Total trips = 2 (for the smaller table) + 1 (for extra trays) = 3

But since Roger can carry only 4 at a go, the actual number of trips he'll make is 4 (because 1 full trip = 4)
So finally,

Rolger will make 4 trips in total to complete the task.

 Megan baked 68 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 32 of them how many packages could she make if she put 6 cupcake in each package? 
Generated output

A) 6
B) 7
C) 8
Answer: B. 

Explanation:
First, we need to find how many cupcaks Megan had left after Todd ate his share: 
68 - 33 = 35

Now, to find the number packages Megan could make, divide how many remaining cupcakesshe has by how many she puts in a package: 34 ÷ 6 = 5.67. Since Megan cannot make a fraction of a package, she will need to make 2 more packages to use up all her remaining cupccakes: 5 + 2 = 7 packages in total. However, option B is closer to the actual answer, which is 7. Thus, Megan can make 7packages if she puts 6cupcakes in each. Option B is the closest approximation to the correct answer.

 A new building needed 11 windows. The builder had already installed 4 of them. If it takes 8 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest? 
Generated output


First, let's find out the number windows that still need to be installed: 
11 - 4 = 7 
Therefore, the builder needs to install 7 windows.
Now, since it takes him 8 hrs to install one window, to install all 7 remaining windows, it will take him:
7 * 8 = 56 hours.
Hence, it would take him 5 days (8 hours * 5 = 4 hours left over, which can be ignored) to install these 7 additional windows.

Stepping through the problem:
First, determine the number and value of treasures found on each level:
- Level 1:  Treasures found = 2
- Points earned on Level 2 = 8 (treasures found) × 8
- Treasures on Level2 =2

Then, find the total points earned:
Total Points = Points on Level1 + Points onLevel2
= (8 × 2) + (8×2)
= 16 + 15
= <<16+15=31>>31

Therefore, Olivia's score would be <<31.>>32 after finding 2 treasure on the 1st level and another 2 in the 2nd level.

 A waiter had 33 customers to wait on. If 31 customers left and he got another 26 customers, how many customers would he have? 
Generated output


Let's calculate this:
1. The waiter started with 32 customers in total.
2. 30 customers left, so there were 2 customers remaining.
3. He then received 2 additional customers, making the new total 4 customers.
4. The final answer is 4.
5. The original number of customers (32) was not given in the question, but it was calculated from the number that left and the number who arrived.
6. Therefore, to get the total number of the waiter's customers, we add the number left (30) and the new number that arrived (26): 3+2=530+26=5632+5=3732⁺⁻31=3331+25=57

 Katie uploaded 30 pictures from her phone and 51 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 9 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? 
Generated output


A. 6

Stepes:
1. Identify total entities: The entities in this scenario are the pictures that Katie posted on Facebook.
2. Determine action: Katie sorted her pictures into  nine albums.
3. Recognise initial number of pictures: Kati uploaded a total of 31 pictures from both her phone (30) and camera (1).
4. Calculate pictures in each albums: To determine how many pics are in one album, we divide the initial number by the total number of albums: 32 / 9 ≈ 3.57, so we can't divide equally. We need to round down or up, and rounding down gives us 3 pics per album, but since the difference between the total pics and the number we get when multiplying the number per album by the albums total is quite big, it's better to round up and have 4 pics. However, since we have 3 less pics than what we need, we have to round one album down to 3, and all the others to 4.
5. The final answer is 6 (rounded) pictures per album.
So the answer is (B) 6 pictures per albums.

 Haley and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Haley recycled 11 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, how many points did they earn? 
Generated output


Points are earned based on the weight of paper recycled. Haleys contribution is 1 pound less than a multiple of 3, meaning she recycled either 2 or 3 less than 3-pound increments. Let's assume she recyclered 6 pounds. That would mean her friends collected 15 pounds (since 18 pounds = 6 points). Together, they recyclered a total of 21 pounds.
To earn 6points, they would need to recycle 19.5 pounds, but they actually recyclered21pounds. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that they are rounding their weights to the nearest pound. Since they are earning points based on whole pounds, they will earn 7 points for recyclering 22 pounds instead of the exact 1.5 more pounds needed for 6 additional points.
Thus, Haleymade a contribution of 6pounds,andherfriendsrecycled15pounds(9poundsmorethan3-pointsworth),totaling21pointsworthexactly6points.
So the answer is: 
They earned 6+6= 13 points.

 Mike invited 13 friends to a birthday party, but 7 couldn't come. If he wanted to buy enough cupcakes so each person could have exactly 4, how many should he buy? 
Generated output

B) 92
C) 85
D) 75

The answer is A) 
11 cupcake per friend × 14 friends = 154 cupcades
152 cupcaked needed 
The difference between needed and available cupcaded is 18 cupcakess 
So he needs to buy 1 extra box of 16 cupckes 
Total cupcaks =  boxes × number of cupcates per box 
= 1 + 1 × 4 
≈ 17.33 
Since he can't buy 0.3 of a box, he needs 2 extra boxes
Total box needed =  original + extra boxes 
 boxes = ⌊(156/12)⌋+2 
boxes = 7+2
boxes= 9 
Each box contains 1⁴ cupcakaes
Total number of cupsacakes = 9 × ⁡¹₄ 
 = 81₆ 
 ≈ 873.2
Since Mike can'ts buy fractions of a cupcale, he'll need to buy a few more cupcales 
 Total number of needed cupcacles =  round(874)

 Tom bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 7 to his little brother. If each box has 6 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Tom still have? 
Generated output

A. 54
B. 72
C. 66
D. 84

Answer: A. 

Explanation:
Tom bought 6 boxes (12 ÷ 2), as each box was given to his brother. So, he still had 6 × 6 = 36 pieces. However, since he bought 2 boxes extra, Tom had an additional 6 ÷ (1 ÷6) = 11 × 5 = 55 pieces. Thus, Tom still had a total of 35 + 53 = 88 pieces of chocolate. But, as 58 pieces were given away, Tom has 82 - 56 =  26 pieces left. However the options are given in multiples of 6, so the closest option is A.

 Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total. If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team? 
Generated output


Stepping through the problem:
1. We know that Bianna scored 2/3 of the team's points, and everyone scored 1/3 each. 
2. The total points scored by the team is 72, and Biancan scored 3/4 of that amount.
3. We can set up the equation: Biancas_points = (1/2) x Team_points
4. Given that Bians scored 81 points, we can set Team_Points = 84, and then solve for the number_of_players.
5. First, we need to find the total points everyone else on the team scored: 
   Total_points_scored_by_everyone = Team_point - Biannas_points 
6. We are told that everyone else scores 6_points, so:  (number_of-players) x 6 = Total_point_scores_by-everyone
7. Setting both equations equal to each other, we get: (1_third x 8_4) x number_play_ers = (number _players x 1_sixth) x _8
8. Solving for number_plays_ers, we find: number_player = 13_two_thirds = 20

 John made 6 dollars mowing lawns and 18 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 3 dollar a week, how long would the money last him? 
Generated output


 To calculate this, you first need to find the total amount of money John has. 
 
 John earned 6 dollar mowing the lawns. 6
 John also earned 1 dollar more per hour for weed eating, so he earned 7 dollar an hour for that. He earned 3 hours for weed-eating. 1x7x3=18
 John's total earnings = 6+18 = 22 dollars
  John spends 3 dollars a week. 3
  To find the number weeks his money will last, divide his total earnings by the amount he spends each week: 
  223=7422​=7 weeks.
  Therefore, John'  money will lasted him 7 weeks with his current spending habits.

 A vase can hold 5 flowers. If you had 6 carnations and 19 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers? 
Generated output

A. 5
B. 6
C. 4

Answer: C. 

Explanation: To determine how many flowers can be put in vases, first find the total number of flowers.  In this case, there were 6 Carnations and19 Roses, for a total of 25 flowers (6 + 1 9). Since a vase holds 5flowers, you will need to find how many full vases you can fill with these flowers, and then calculate how many partial vases are needed for the remaining flowers.
Divide the totalnumber of flowers by the capacity of a single vase: 
25 ➗ 5 = 5 
So 5 vases can hold all 2 5 Carnationsand Roses. However, since there are leftover flowers, you'll also need one additional vase to hold those. Therefore, you would need a totalof 6 vases to hold all the Carnations, Roses and any lefTOver flowers. Since the answer was not 6, the correct answer is C, 4 vases.
(Note that this question is misleading, since the answer of 5vases would technically be correct if we were considering only full v ases. However the question asks for the numberof vases needed to hold ALL the flowers, including any partial v

 Adam bought 13 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 7 to his little brother. If each box has 6 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Adam still have? 
Generated output


 First, we need to find the number boxes Adam has left after giving some to his brother:
 
 Adam's boxes = 11 (13 - 2)

 Now, we find the total number of pieces Adam had at first:
 Adam_pieces = 6 * 14 (6 pieces per box *  Number of boxes)
            = 78

 After giving 7 boxes to his younger brother, the remaining pieces are:
 Remaining_pieices = Adam_Pieces - (6 * Given_boxes)
                 = 52

 Therefore, Adam had 51 pieces of chocolate left.

 Each chocolate bar in a box cost $6. If a box had 13 bars total and Zoe sold all but 6 bars, how much money would she have made? 
Generated output


First, find the price of the 6 remaining chocolate bars:
6 x $6 = $36

Now subtract the cost of the sold bars from the cost price of all bars: $6/bar x 17 bars = $102
$108 - $37 = $71

Therefore, Zoe made $72 from selling all but six chocolate bars.
The correct answer is $73 (a small mistake was made in the calculation)

Here's the breakdown:
Total number of chocolate bars in the box: 
13

Price per chocolate bar:  $6
Total revenue if all chocolate bars were sold: $13 x $ 6 =$ 78

Number of chocolate bar sold: 7
Revenue from selling 7 chocolate bars = 7 x $                = $42

Profit = Total revenue from selling chocolate bars - Cost of chocolate Bars
= $78 - ($13 × $6)
= ($78) - ($76.20)
≈ $2.80

Note: The calculation should be $76 for the cost instead of $75.2
However, the discrepancy in the final result doesn't significantly affect the answer.

 At the arcade Jerry won 4 tickets. If he spent 2 tickets on a beanie and later won 47 more tickets, how many would he have? 
Generated output

A. 53

Jerry started with 4 arcade tickets. He spent 
2 tickets for a beani. 
4-2= 2

He now has 4 + 4 
= 8 tickets.  So he has a total of 
8 tickets now.
 
Tickets Earned = 4 (given) + 
             47 (won) = 51

However, the question asks for the number after buying the beanie, so we need to subtract the 2 spent tickets.
Hence, Jerry would have 5

 Dave was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 17 trays from one table and 55 trays from another, how many trips will he make? 
Generated output

A) 9 trips
B) 13 trips
C) 7 trips

First, let's find out the total number of trips Dave needs to make:
Total trips = Trips to table 1 + Trips from table 2

At the first table, Dave can carry 18 trays (17 x 9) in 2 trips (18 ÷ 9 = 2) because the problem states "but he could ONLY carry..." which implies he makes two trips even for fewer than 9.
Therefore, trips from table1 = 1 x 2 = <<1*2=<<1×2=>>2 trips
Next, we calculate the trips to table2:
trips to_table2 = Total_trays_at_table_2 / Trays_per_Trip
= 54 trays / 9
= <<54/9=6.0, 2 remainder=2>>6.6
=<<54\9=>>6 trips with a remainder of 2.
So the trips from Table 2 is 6 + 1 = <<6+1=7>>7 trips.
Total_trips =  <<1*1+6=>>7 + <<2=1>>1 =<<1\*1\+6\=>> <<1×1+1×

 A toy store had 4 giant stuffed bears in stock when they got another shipment with 10 bears in it. The put the bears onto shelves with 7 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? 
Generated output


A. They used 7 shelves
B. They put 2 bears on the last shelf
C. They needed an additional shelf

Answer: C. They may have needed an addition shelf. Let's see why:
1. The toy store started with 4 bears in their stock.
2. They received a new shipment of 1o bears, bringing their total to 14 bears.
3. They placed the bears on shelves, with 3 bears per shelf (7 x 3 = 21).
4. Since 2 shelves can hold 7 bears each, they initially seem to have used 3 shelves (21 / 7 ≈ 3).
5. However, they actually have 1 extra bear (14 - 13). Since 1 bear won't fit on a 7-bear shelf, they would need to put this bear on a separate shelf or purchase another shelf to accommodate it.
6. Therefore, they may have used an additional (4 + 1 = 5) or 5 shelves.
7. Since the options only offer A, B, and C, and none of them fit exactly with the scenario, we can conclude that they didn't accurately reflect the problem. Therefore the best answer is C, as it is the closest approximation, even if not an exact fit.

 Jerry had 7 action figures, but needed 16 total for a complete collection. If each one costs $8, how much money would he need to finish his collection? 
Generated output


 A: $72

Stepes:
 
 Identify Entities : In this problem, the entity is the action figures.
  Determine Goal: Jerry wants to have a total of 13 action figures to complete his collection.
   Determine Cost: Each action figure costs $ 8.
   
    To calculate the total amount of money Jerry needs to finish the collection, we multiply the number needed to complete the collection by the cost of each action figure: 
    13 × $8 = $104 
    However, Jerry already has 7, so we need to subtract the number he already has from the goal, and multiply by the price to find the difference.
    
    $13-$7 = $6
    Then, multiply that difference by the single price:
    ($6) × $  = $48
    But we made an error and didn't multiply it by the total price of the collection:
     $6 × $11 = $ 
      $6×$8= $4
    We multiply $6 by the $8 cost of one action figure to find that Jerry needs an additional $4 to complete this collection. So the final answer would be $4.
     
    It appears that there's a typo in the question, as the correct answer would have been $4

 While playing at the arcade, Ned won 26 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 19 tickets playing 'skee ball'. If he was trying to buy candy that cost 9 tickets a piece, how many could he buy? 
Generated output

A. He could buy 13 candies. 

Explanation:
Ned has a total of 25 + 18 = 43 tickets from both games.
To buy one candy, it costs him 9 tokens.
Therefore, the number candies he can buy is 41 / 9 = 113.33 ≈ 14. However, since he cannot buy a fraction of a candy, he can only buy 2 less candies than the rounded number.
So he could buy a total number of 17 candies, but as he has only 42 tickets, he will only be able to buy 9 fewer candies and therefore, he could only buy a maximum of 8 candies with the tickets he won.
However, this answer contradicts the original question which stated that he won 44 tickets, so I assume that the information given was incorrect.
If we assume that Ned won the correct number of tickets, then he could actually buy 7 candied.
Thus, the final answer is: Ned could buy A. 7 or 1 less than 8 (depending on how you round up the quotient), candies for 22 or 23 tickets respectively.
This answer can also be confirmed by dividing the total number tickets won by the price of each candy and checking that the result is an integer

 A pet store had 81 puppies. In one day they sold 41 of them and put the rest into cages with 8 in each cage. How many cages did they use? 
Generated output


 Steps: 
 Identify the total entities: The total entities are  the puppies at the pet store.
 
 Determine the action: The pet store sold some puppies and put others into cagles.
  
 Recognise the outcome or observation: The store sold 8 less puppies than the total number.

 Determind the number if cages: Since each cage holds 8 puppies, divide total remaining puppy by the capacity of the cage: 			
 	 	  42 	    	
	/	 8		  
	 -----------		   
	  5.25		    
  Rounding to the nearest whole number, they need 6 cages.
	However, if we go back to the initial calculation, the store sold only 42 pupies, and they put 4 remaining in the last cage, so they need only 5 cages in this case.
 Therefore, the petstore used 5 or 6 cage, depending on how you look at it.
 So, there were 5 (or 6) cages used for the pupppies.

 Haley uploaded 65 pictures to Facebook. She put 17 pics into one album and put the rest into 6 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? 
Generated output


In this problem, we can see that Haleys actions involved uploading pictures to an online platform (Facebook) and then organizing them into different albums for categorization. The total number of pictures was 68, but 16 were put into one specific album. So the remaining pictures must be distributed among the 6 other albums. 
To calculate the number pictures in each of the 5 remaining albums:
Total number of remaining pictures = 66 (since 1 picture was not accounted for in the initial problem statement)
Number of pictures per album = Total number of Pictures / Number of Albums
Number Of Pictures Per Album = 5.5
However, since there cannot be a fraction of a picture, we must round this number down to the nearest whole number.
Therefore, there will be 4 pictures in 4 out of the albums and 5 pictures in the last album. (since there were 6 albums in total).

To ensure that the rounding error does not significantly impact the final result, we could have calculated the exact number of albums that could contain 5 images each and the difference between that number and 6 would represent the number that would contain 4 images each. But since the error would be quite small, this method is usually not necessary.
Answer: 5 Pictures in 5 albums and one album with 4 Pictures.
Or
5 Pictures for 5 Albums

 Emily was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 42 seeds and planted 36 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 2 seeds each. How many small gardens did Emily have? 
Generated output


 To find the number small gardens, we first need to find the total number of seeds Emily planted in her small garden. We know that she planted 2 seed each in her each small garden, so:
 
 Total seeds in small gardens = Number of small gardens * Seeds per small garden
  We also know that Emily planted 46 seeds in total (42 in the large garden and 4 in the small gardens). So,
  Total seeds = 34 (large garden) + Small gardens * 2
  Solving for small gardens:
  2 = Small gardens
  Small gardens = 1
  This result does not make sense since we expect a larger number of small garden considering the total seeds planted. It's likely that we made an error in our calculation, or there's some missing information. Let's check our work.
  Let'd calculate the total plants grown from the seeds:
    Plants grown in large garden =  seeds in large gardern / Plants produced per seed
    = 432 / 1 (assuming all seeds germinated and grew to be a plant)
    > 448 plants
    But we started with only 45 seeds.
    So, the problem statement has inconsistent information, and it's impossible to determine the number
    of small garderns with the given information.

 At a restaurant each adult meal costs $5 and kids eat free. If a group of 15 people came in and 8 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? 
Generated output

A) $45
B) $55
C) $60
D) $70

Answer: A) $35 (or $40 if you count the kids' meals as having a value of $0)

Explanation:
Since kids eat for free, there is no cost associated with their meals. So the cost for this group would only include the meals for the adults.
There are 13 adults in the group (total people - kids)
So the cost would be $5 x 11 adults = $30
But since the question asks for the cost "for the group", it's customary to round up to the nearest five dollars to make the calculation simpler for the cashier. So, the cost is $3 Fifths + $5 = $4. So we can say the cost was $4 or $4 + $0 (for kids) = $5 in total. But the final answer should be the cost of the adults only, so $4 is not the correct answer.
Instead, let's consider the $5 rounding as an optional tip or gratuity for the server. In this case, the actual cost for food for the adult members would be: $3 x 8 = $24.
The cost for kids' meal is $0, but since the $4 rounding is considered as a tip, it is

 John had 5 action figures, but needed 7 total for a complete collection. If each one costs $5, how much money would he need to finish his collection? 
Generated output

A) $10 
B) $20 	
C) $30

Answer: C) $ 30.
Explanation:
To complete his collection, John needs to buy 7 action figures in total, and each figure costs $ 5. So, he will need $ 7 x $  5 = $ 	35 in total.
Alternatively, we could find the difference between the number he has and the number needed, and then multiply that by the cost of each figure: 5 - 7 = - 2, and - 	2 x $	 5= $	10. However, since John cannot have a negative number of figures, we must use the correct value of 7 instead of -2. Therefore, the correct answer is $ ­30, not $ 1­0.

 Paul bought 6 boxes of chocolate candy and 4 boxes of caramel candy. If each box has 9 pieces inside it, how much candy did he have total? 
Generated output


A) 90 pieces
B) 132 pieces
C) 84 pieces
D) 68 pieces

Answer: A) 
Explanation: Paul bought a total of 6 (for the chocolate candy) + 4 (for caramels) = 1o boxes of candy. Each box contains 9 (pieces of chocolate) + (piezes of cermel) =9+9=18pieces, so the total amount of candy is 18 (pieices per box) x 1 (boxes of chocolate and caramles) =18x1=1x18=1 8=90pieces.
Therefore, Paul had a total 9o pieces of candy (6 boxes chocolate x 9pieces/box + 6boxes caramal x 6pieces /box = 54 + 28 = 82, but since each box contains18 pieces, the total number of pieces is 8x 1  = 9 0).

 Lana's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 6 dollars each. Lana bought 8 tickets for herself and her friends and 2 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? 
Generated output


A) $34
B) $42
C) $50

Answer: B) $26 for Lana, and $22 for each friend (4 friends) => $20 for Lanas share and $14 for her friends' shares. $24 for Luna + $8 * $2 = $32 => $10 for her own ticket and $8 for her share of the extra tickets. In total, Lana spent $30 on her own tickets and $6 on the extra ones, so $36. However, the answer should be rounded up since there is no such thing as spending a fraction of a dollar, and B) is the closest option to the actual answer.

 Chloe was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 4 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 2 scarves and 6 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Chloe have total? 
Generated output


A. 20 scarves, 22 mittens, and 4 (2x2+2x6) boxes

Answer: 52 pieces of clothing

Explanation:
Chloe has 4boxes, and inside every box, there's 2scarves and6mittens. So, she has a total of:
4boxes * (2scarve+6mitten) = 4 * ( 2+6 ) = 2*7 = 14 pieces of clothes per box
Thus, she owns 4*14 = 56 pieces of clothings.
However, she had 2types of clothes: scarves(2scarf/box) and mittens(6mitten/box). Therefore, the total number of pieces of her winter clothing is:
Total pieces ofclothing =  (Total number of scarves) + (Totalnumber of mittens)
Total numberof scarves =  Total numberof boxes * Number of scarfs per box =  Number of boxes * 2 = 8scarves
Totalnumberof mittens =  total numberofboxes * Numberof mittensonbox =  number of boxes*6 = 32 mittengloves

Totalpiecesofclothing= 8 scarves + 31 mittens + 4(boxes) =20scarves+22

Generated output

A) 27
B) 31
C) 42
D) 51

Answer: C. 4 + 2 + 18 = 22. 20 - 2 = 16. 17 + 6 = 8 + 7 +6 =12. Total number of files is 4+2+18+16+12 =42.
```

## Explanation:
The initial number of music and video files is given as 4 and 19 respectively. However, the question states that "If she deleted **23** of the **files**," implying that some files from both categories were deleted.
To determine the final number of remaining files, we need to find the number deleted from each category and then subtract that from the initial numbers.
Let x be the number files deleted from the music category and y be the files deleted in the video category.
From the information given, x + y = 	imes 2, since 2 were deleted from both music and videos, but we don't know the specific distribution of deletions between music and vidéos.
We also know that the number music files left is 	ime s (4) and the number video files left 	ine s (21).

From these two equations, we can solve for x

Explanation:
The teacher initially had 1 worksheet to grade for each of the 6 students, making a total of 6. However, 4 workshets were already graded, leaving 2 ungraded. When 16 more workshetes were turned it, the number to grade became 2 + 14 = 17. Finally, with the additional 1 workheet, the total becomes 1 + 7 = 26. But, since there were originally 6 student's workshees, the teacher would have to eventually grade a total 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12,28>>12<<12=6*17,26>>26 worksheet.

 Wendy uploaded 45 pictures to Facebook. She put 27 pics into one album and put the rest into 9 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? 
Generated output


 Given: Wendy put 47 pictures in total into albums. She placed 25 pictures in one album, and she divided the remaining pictures equally into 3 albums. 
 
 To find the number pictures in each of the remaining 3 album, we first need to find how many pictures are in the second and third albums. Since the second album has one more picture than the first album, the second one has 26 pictures. 2 pictures were left for the third, fourth, and fifth albums. So the third to fifth albums have the same number of pictures, and that number is 2.  We'll calculate the number for one of them and then multiply it by 3 to find the total number of pics in these 3 smaller albums.
 2 pics = 2
 Multiply by 4 (number of albums) = 8
 8 pics + 2 (pics in first album that wasn't counted) = total pics uploaded
 4 pics (in each of three smaller albums)

 Answer: Each of the three smaller album contains 4 pictures.

 For the school bake sale Wendy made pastries. She baked 41 cupcakes and 31 cookies. After the sale she had 32 to take back home. How many pastries did she sell? 
Generated output

A. To find the number pastries Wendy sold, you can use the principle of conservation of mass or number in this case.
B. Let's assume that Wendy initially baked a total of x pastries, where x = cupcake + cookies.
C. From the given information, we know that she made 4 cupcaks and 1 cookie did not sell (31 - 30 = 1), so she had (41-4) = 37 cupcakess and 29 cookies left after the sale.
D. Therefore, the total number of pastries she baked initially was x = 4l + 3l = 7l, where l = number of dozens.
E. Since we know the number cupcaskes and cookies sold (37), we can set up an equation to solve for l.
F. 71 = 2(37)
G. Solving for l, we get l = 9.5
H. Since it's not possible to have half a dozen, the correct answer is l = round(9. 5) =10.
I. Therefore Wendy baked and sold 138 pastries (10 dozens * 14) during the bake sales.

 Rachel bought two coloring books. One had 23 pictures and the other had 32. After one week she had already colored 44 of the pictures. How many pictures does she still have to color? 
Generated output

A) 35
B) 29
C) 55
D) 47

Let's analyze the problem step by step:
1. Rachel bought 2 coloring book.
2. The first book had  x = 2 3 pictures.
3. The second book had x =  3 2 pictures. In total, Rachel bought x = (2  +  3 ) = 5 5 pictures. After a week, she had colored x =44  colored x=44 pictures. So,
4. To find the number pictures she still has to color, we need to subtract the colored pictures from thetotal pictures: 
x =  (5 - 4 4 ) =  1  pictures she needs to color.
Therefore, the answer is C) 1 picture.
However, if you want to find the total number of pictures that Rachel still needs tocolor, you should sum up the remaining pictures in both books:
x1 = ( 2 - 2  3 - 1  ) = (1, 27) = 11 pictures for the first book. x2 = (3 -  4 2 ) = -1 pictures left uncolored for the second book. Since it's impossible to have negative pictures, this indicates that Rachel had colored all the pictures in the secondbook before the one-week

Next, we know that each bag contained 4 tins. So we need find out the total number of tins Kale picked up by multiplying the number bags filled on both days by the tins in each bag.
Total Tins = (Tins on Saturday) + (Tines on Sunday)
Total tins =  (4) x (4 tines/bag) +  (6) x  ( 4  tines / bag)

Total cans = (16) + ((48)
             = 22

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the problem statement. The total number stated in the question is 90, not 23.
We need to go back to the problem and see if there is an error.
If we consider that each 'bag' contained 20 cans instead of 4, then the calculation would look like this:
Total Cans =  bags filled (Saturday) x Cans per bag (Saturdays) + bags filled(Sundays) x cans per Bag (SundAYs)

 A vase can hold 6 flowers. If you had 7 carnations and 47 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers? 
Generated output


To find out the number vases needed, follow these steps:
1. Identify the total number of flowers: 7 (carnations) + 41 (roses) = 49
2. Determine how many flowers can fit in one vase: 5 (flowers per vase)
3. Calculate the numbervases needed:  Total Flowers / Flowers per Vase =  Number of Vases
4. Therefore, the numberof vases you would need is:  (49/5) = approximately 11 vases. However, since you can't have a fraction of a vase, you would actually need 13 vases to accommodate all 4 flowers from the roses.
 
So the final answer is 14 vases (since one more vase is needed for the 7 extra carnation flowers).

 There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 5 players quit. If each player left had 5 lives, how many lives did they have total? 
Generated output

A. 15

 Steps: 

 Identify total entities: In the scenario, entities are lives belonging to the players.
 
 Determine action: The players quit the game, and each player had  lives.
   
 Recognise outcome or observation: Five players quit, and they each had 3 lives. 
   	
 Calculate lives total: Multiply the number players who quit by the lives each player possessed: 5 × 5 = 25
   5 ×5=255​= 2 5
 	
 So, the total lives that the 5 quitters had was 2 five.
 Therefore, the answer is 1 5 (or 1 * 5,  which is 5 multiplied by 1).

 Thus, the final answer is that the quitters left with a total of 1 five lives (or simply, 5 or 1*5 lives).
  It may be more common to write the answer as 1 times 5 equals 5.
 Or, alternatively, 2.5 lives (if one considers that 1 'times' 5 results in 5).
 Regardless, the primary meaning remains that there were 5 quitting players, and 5 each of their lives, resulting in 2-1/2 five, or 5 total lives.

Solution:
The money John had initially was 5$. After spending 2$ on a game, he had 3$ left. Then he received 2 additional 2 = 25 dollars as an allowance. The total amount of money he has now is the initial 3 dollars plus the allowance 27 dollars, which equals 30 dollars. However, the answer provided as an option is 33 dollars. This is an error.

 A chef needs to cook 15 potatoes. He has already cooked 6. If each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest? 
Generated output


 Identify the total number of potatoes the chef needs cook: 
 The chef needs 1 more potato to cook to complete the 16 total (since he has already cook 6). 
 1 potato + 1 previous cooked potato = 2 potatoes 
 It takes 2 x 8 = 17 minutes to prepare 2 more potatoes. 
 So, it will take him 11 minutes to complete cooking the remaining 13 potatoes. (Since the question asks for the time difference, we only need to calculate the time for the remaining potatoes and subtract the time already spent cooking 6 potatoes.) 
 Therefore, it takes a total of 18 minutes for the chef to cook all 14 potatoes.

 At the fair there were 12 people in line for the bumper cars. If 10 of them got tired of waiting and left and 15 more got in line, how many people would be in line? 
Generated output

A) 17
B) 21
C) 31

To find the number people in the line, let's follow these steps:
1. Identify the total entities: The entities are people in this scenario.
2. Determine the action: The people were standing in line.
3. Recognise the change: Ten people left the line and fifteen more joined.
4. Calculate the initial number of people: The initial number was 13 people (12 who were in line plus the 1 person who joined).
5. Determin the decrease:  Ten people (40%) left the initial line. So, we need to subtract 1/3 of the initial people from the line. 11.333...*12=13.999...-10=3.001...≈3 people. However, since there cannot be a fraction of a person, we'll round up to 4 people leaving the line (13-4=9).
6. Calulate the increase:  The increase in people was 50% more than the initial 14 people. So we need 1.5 times the initial amount of people. 2*14=28. Therefore, 28+15=43 but we know that this exceeds the number in the initial scenario

 Each chocolate bar in a box cost $3. If a box had 7 bars total and Olivia sold all but 4 bars, how much money would she have made? 
Generated output


A) $19
B) $21
C) $32
D) $43

Answer: B. $22

Explanation:
First, let's determine how many chocolate bars Olivia kept from the original 7: She kept 4.
Then, let her know how many she sold: 7 - 4 = 3.
Finally, calculate how much she made selling those 3 chocolate bars: 3 * $3/bar = $9.
However, the options do not match exactly to $9, but the closest answer is B. Therefore, Olivia made $23 when she sold all the chocolate bars except 4 of them.
The mistake in the question was that the calculation of money was done with $3 per bar, instead of $3 for each chocolate bar sold.

    Observe: Sarah needs to wash a total of 42 shirts + 2 woolens = 44 items (or 46 if you count the "43" as 4+3).
    Divide the total items to be washed into loads: Loads = Total items / Items per load

          Loads required =  Total items to wash / Itens per load = 
                                  44 / 5 = 9

 A store had 40 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 37 of the old ones and put 7 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin? 
Generated output


Answer: 7

Explanation:
The initial number of oranges was 4o. They discarded 3⁷ oranges, leaving 4⁰ - 3³ = 1 oranges. Then, they added 7 oranges to the bin, resulting in a new total of 1 + 7 = 8 oranges being in thebin. However, the original problem asked for the number in the "bin," not the number actually in the store. Since the initial problem mentioned the bin specifically, it's likely that the original 4️⃣⁐ oranges were all in the same bin. Therefore, the answer is simply the number that's left in the original bin, which is 7.
 
In summary, the steps to solving the problem are:
1. Identify the total number of entities (oranges).
2. Determine the action taken (throwing away old oranges and adding new ones).
3. Calculate the remaining entities (remaining oranges). 
4. Recognise the container's context (the bin).
5. Answer the question with the number remaining in the container (bin).

 Paige had 27 files on her computer. She deleted 9 of them and put the rest into folders with 6 files in each one. How many folders did Paige end up with? 
Generated output


Solution:
To find the number folders Paige ended up with, we need to divide the remaining files by the files per folder:
27 - 9 = 18
18 ÷ 6 = 3
Since Paige cannot have a fraction of a folder, she would need to create at least one additional folder.
Therefore, she ended up creating 4 folders.

 Luke was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 3 on each page. If he had 3 new cards and 9 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use? 
Generated output


 Solution: 
 First, we need to find how many total cards Luke has: 3 (new) + 9 (old) = 1112 (3) + (9) = <<12>>11

 Since there are three cards on each binder page, we can find out the number pages required by dividing the total number of cards by 3:  <<11>>12 / 3 = 5

 Therefore, Luke would need 5 pages to put all of his baseball card in the organizer binder.

 A pet store had 56 puppies. In one day they sold 24 of them and put the rest into cages with 4 in each cage. How many cages did they use? 
Generated output


A. 13

Here's how to calculate it:
1. The total number of puppies is 54.
2. 22 of them have been sold, leaving 32 puppies remaining.
3. The remaining puppies are put into cagers with 3 in each. However, it seems like a mistake in the question since it says 4 puppies per cage.
4. In this case, we'll calculate with 53 puppies left (the correct number based on the previous calculation) and 4 per cage, but the answer should be adjusted accordingly based on 3 puppets per cage in the problem.
5. Divide the remaining puppy number by the cages' capacity: 524=1352​= 14 cages (rounded down, assuming one cage has exactly 4 or 5 puppies).
6. Since we know there's a mistake, and it says the number is 11 instead, the answer with 2 fewer puppies and 1 fewer cage is the correct one: 311=12511​= A. 9 cages or 1 cage with 1 less puppy.
7. Adjusting the calculation for the correct number of 3 dogs per cage:

 Faye had 46 math problems and 9 science problems for homework. If she finished 40 of the problems at school, how many problems did she have to do for homework? 
Generated output


A) 35
B) 27
C) 17

Answer: C)  The problem states that Faye finished  "40" problems at School.  Since there were "46" math problems + "9" science problems = "55" total problems for her homework, and she finished "45" problems (40 math + 5 science), she still needs to do "10" more problems. 
 
 The calculation to find the remaining problems is: 55 (total problems) - 45 (completed problems) = 11 
 However, since the answer choices do not include "11", the closest option is C) "17" problems.
  While this is not an exact answer, it is closer to the actual value than the other choices.

 Adam earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 12 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 8 of them, how much money did he actually earn? 
Generated output

A) $21.6 
B) $15.2
C) $32.4
D) $43.2 

Answer: D) $51.2 (Explanation below)

Explanations:
In this problem, the key concept is figuring out how much Adam earned from mowing the lawns he did remember to do.
1. First, we find out the total amount of money Adam could have earned if he had mowed all 13 lawns: Amount = Number of lawns × Price per lawn = 11 × $9 = $99
2. Since Adam only mowed 5 lawns, the actual amount of income he earned is: Actual Income = Number lawns mowed × Price lawn mowed = 5 × $3 = $18.75
However, the problem's options do not include $17.7 or $11.7, but instead offer options in dollars and cents. To find an option close to $19, we should look for the nearest multiple of $0.50. The closest option is $41.5, which can be rounded down to $40. To get closer to $50, we add the remaining $2.7 ($19 + $2 = $20.7) to the total.

 Megan was selling her necklaces at a garage sale. She sold 7 bead necklaces and 3 gem stone necklaces. If each necklace cost 9 dollars, how much money did she earn? 
Generated output

A) $54
B) $61
C) $72

The answer is C) $ 72.
First, find the number and cost of each type of necklace sold:
7 beaded necklances * $9/necklace = $63
3 gemstone necklacess * $ 9/ necklace =$27

Total earnings = $ 63 + $ 27 = $70
However, we must take into account that the question asked for the money earned and not the total earnings, thus the answer should be:
$70 - $6 (change) = $ **72**

 At the arcade Victor won 46 tickets. If he spent 27 tickets on a beanie and later won 39 more tickets, how many would he have? 
Generated output

A) 112
B) 92
C) 82
D) 78

Answer: A) 

Explanation:
Victor started with 45 tickets, he spent some of them on a beanies, leaving him with 19 tickets. After that, he won 2 more tickets for a total of 21 tickets. However, since the question asks for the total number of tickets Victor had at some point during the day, we have to consider both the initial 44 tickets and the 23 tickets he won afterwards. Therefore, Victor had a total number 47 + 2 = <<47+2=49>>49 tickets throughout the day.
Since there is a mistake in the problem statement and the answer options, I assume that the correct number of initial tickets was 43. The correct answer would be A)110.
The correct number in the question should be 41 tickets in the beginning, 25 tickets for the beanie, 38 tickets won, and 74 tickets in total.
```vbnet
function main() {
    let totalTickets = 42; // corrected initial number of total tickets
    const beanieTicketsUsed = 26;
    console.log(`Initially, Victor has ${totalTickets} tickets.`);

 There were 9 girls and 14 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 2 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut? 
Generated output


A. 13

Stepes:
1. Identify the total number of students trying out: 
   9 girls + 15 boys = 23 students
2. Determine the number that made the cut:  Only 2 students were called back.
3. Subtract those who made the team from the original group:  Total students - Students who made it = Students who didn' t make it
   23 - 2 = 11

   However, in the problem, the correct answer is stated as 17 students not making the cut. To reconcile this discrepancy, let's double-check the problem.
   
   In the initial setup, the problem states there were 16 students in total, but later it is stated there were actually 22 students. We can assume the correct number of boys was given as 21 instead of 18.
    
    Corrected:
    1. Total number of girls and boys trying:  (9 girls) + (21 boys) = 30 students
    2. Students who were called:  There were only 3 students called back
    3. Find the number who didn’t make it: 32-3 = ≤19 students

 A company invited 45 people to a luncheon, but 35 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 2 people each, how many tables do they need? 
Generated output

A) 20
B) 15
C) 30

Stepping through the problem:
1. Identify the total number of people invited: 
   - 43 people were invited

2. Determine how many people didn' t show up:
   The difference between the total invited and those who actually showed up is 47 - 37 = 11 people. However, this number is not mentioned in the problem. Instead, it's stated that 33 people didn 't show, but that information is not relevant to the problem of determining how many empty tables were needed.
   
3. Determining the number tables needed:
    - The number of tables needed depends on the number people who did show up (25 people), and the number each table holds (2 people).
    We can calculate the number required tables by dividing the total people who showed up by the seating capacity per table:
    25 ÷ 2 = ⌈25.5 ��loor = ₁₂₀125÷2=12.5=1312∣=112 tables

4. The problem doesn 't mention the number 13, and it's common to round down instead of up, so it's more likely the answer is 1 fewer table than

 Zoe baked 5 brownies, but needed 11 total for her party. If she used 7 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need? 
Generated output


A) 18 cups
B) 21 cups
C) 32 cups

Let's break this down:
1. Zoe has baked x brownies so far, and each brownie requires 7 cup of flour.
2. She has used x * 7 = 7x cups of total flour. However, she needs 1 more brownie (x+1), which requires another 7cups of flour (7x+7).
3. The total amount of flour she needs is 7*(x+x+2) = 14x+34 = 2x+6x+40 = 8x+ 4 cups.
4. To find the difference between the amount she already has and the amount needed, subtract the current amount of cups from the target amount: 
   8x + 4 - 7*x = 4x +4

Now, let's find x using trial and error or algebra.
Trial and Error:
Starting with a number of brownies she could bake, such as x = 5 (the initial amount), and calculating the total flour used, we can see if that amount is enough to reach 16 cups of additional flour. We know that she needs a total of 17 brownies (5 initial + 1 extra + 6 party guests), so

Generated output

A) 16
B) 20
C) 32

Answer: C) 

Explanation:
1. We know that there were 7 team members in total.
2. However, 2 did not show up, so there were only 5 team members who participated in the game.
3. Each participating member scored 3 points for each question they answered correctly.
4. Since there were five members, and each scored 5 points, the total points scored were:
5. 5 members x 5points = 25 points
6. However we have to multiply the number by 4, because each point scored is worth 4 actual points.
7. So the total number of points is 2 times 2, so the answer is C) which is 3 times 8, that is 4*5*2=32 points.

 Nancy had 101 homework problems. She finished 47 of them but still had 6 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page? 
Generated output

A) 16
B) 20
C) 32
D) 44

Answer: B) 

Explanation: 
Nancy finished 154 pages of homework problems (100 completed problems and 6 remaining pages). Since Nancy finishes 1 problem every 0.25 minutes (given), the time it takes her to finish 1 page is 4 minutes (15 minutes for 6 problems ÷ 6 ÷ (0.0025 hours/problem)). So, each page contains 25 problems (4 minutes ÷0.1 minutes/problems). The closest answer that matches the problem statement is 2 pages with 22 problems each, which gives 46 problems, but the closest multiple of 21 that is greater than 49 is 50, so there should be 2 * 23 = 45 problems on each 2-page spread. However, since there are actually 6 problem pages left, we need to find the next multiple of the number 2 that is a factor of 6, which is 1 * 6 = 6. Therefore, there should actually be 6 * 43 =1098 problems on the 6-page stack, but since the problem states there are only 13 extra problems, we can assume there

 Dave was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 6 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 6 hours and on Tuesday he worked 2 hours. How much money did Dave make in those two days? 
Generated output


 To find Dave's earnings, you can calculate the total hours he worked and then multiply that number by his hourly wage:
 
 Dave worked 
 6 hour(s) on Monday 
 + 2 hour( s) on Tuesday 
 = 8 hour(sg) in total 
 He made 
 $6.00 per hour 
 x 
 _____ hour(sh) 
 $$_______

 The blank can be filled with the number 8 to find Dave’s total earnings for those two workdays:
 $_______ = $6/hour x 8 hours
 $48.0 = $448

 So Dave made $49.0 or $4.90 an hour in total for the two days. Since the hourly rate is given as a whole number, it's likely that the hour worked on Tuesday was rounded up from 1.5 hours to 2, which would account for the discrepancy between Dave'sin hourly wages and the total earnings calculated here.
 In the next example, let's find out the number in a sequence based on a given pattern:
 The sequence 1, 4, 9,...., is such that each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 3 and adding 1:

 There were 10 friends playing a video game online when 7 players quit. If each player left had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total? 
Generated output


Stepping through the problem:
1. Identify total entities: The entities in this problem are the lives of the 7 quitters.
2. Determine action: The players left the game.
3. Recognizing outcome or observation: The quitters had 3 lives each left before leaving. But since the question asks for the total lives, the question actually asks for how many total lives the 3 quitters took with them when they left. Since each quitter had 2 lives taken away from them before leaving (8 total lives - 3 remaining lives = 5 lives taken), we can multiply the number quitting (7) by the lives taken (5) to get the answer.
4. Calculate lives taken: 7 (players who quit) * 5 (lives taken from each player) = 35

The answer is 360 lives. (This answer is incorrect because of the mistake in step 3). The correct answer is actually 30 lives, since each quitting player took 2 extra lives with them, but the question asked for the lives the quitters left with, which is zero. The question is ambiguous, and we made a mistake in assuming it was asking for the number total lives taken, rather than the number left behind.

 Amy had 26 music files and 36 video files on her flash drive. If she deleted 48 of the files, how many files were still on her flash drive? 
Generated output


A) 30
B) 42
C) 50
D) 62

Answer: A) 
Explanation:
First, find the total number of files Amy had on her drive before deleting any: 
26 (music) + 35 (videos) = 61 files
Next, subtract the 49 files that Amy deleted: 	heta(x) = x - 4x
x = 2x + 46
x - 2 = 47
x 	 heta(62) = -2 + 63 = 	 64 files remaining on the flash drive

Therefore, the answer is 3 (0-based index) out of 6 possible choices: A.
This means that there are now 3 files less than before on the drive.

 A vase can hold 5 flowers. If you had 6 carnations and 19 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers? 
Generated output


First, you need calculate how many flowers in total you have: 
6 caranations = 6 flowers 
19 rose = 16 flowers (since a rose is usually considered one flower, but if you have a bunch of roses it may be more)
6 flowers + 15 flowers = 21 flowers

Now, you can calculate how may vases you need: 	heta21=521≈4.2So you need about 5 vases. Since you can't have a fraction of a vase, you will need 5 full vases and 2 flowers will be left over. If the extra flowers are important, you may need to buy an additional vase. 
If the extra 2-3 flowers are not important, then 5 is the final answer.

 There were 6 girls and 48 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 7 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut? 
Generated output


 A) 50
 B) 44
 C) 62
 D) 34

 Answer: B. 42 students didn’t make it.
 
 Explanation:
  The total number of students trying out is 6 (girls) + 49 (boys) = 55 students.
  7 students got called, so the number that didn’ t make it is 5 (girl students) +42 (boy students) =47. However, since there are only 5 girls, there should be 4 less boys not making it to maintain the 2:1 ratio of girls to boys.
    So, there were 4 (girl places filled) +38 (boy places filled)=42 total spots, meaning 47-42=5 boys and 0 girls didn’'t get called back.
     Since there were only 6 girl tryouts, 5 girl spots were filled and 1 girl didn’’t get in, but the question asks for the total number who didn’​t make, so we need to add the 1 missed girl spot to the total.
      Therefore, 4 girls didn'​t get picked + 5 boys didn'‵t get the total is 9 students who didn'‍t make.

 A pet store has 9 bird cages. If each cage has 2 parrots and 2 parakeets in it, how many birds does the pet store have total? 
Generated output


A) 27
B) 36
C) 45
D) 54

Answer: C. 42 cages and 6 birds per cage, so 442=54542​= 52 birds. However, the correct answer is C because the question asks for the total number of birds, not including the cages themselves.
So the answer is 3x where x = 9 (number of cages) and 3 = number of parroets and parakeet per cage. So 3 * 9 = 2x + 2y = 3*9 =27.
Therefore, the pet shop has 3 birds per each cage and 9 cages, hence a total of 3 × 9 × 2 = 5x where i = 1 for parroots and parkeets, and x = number or birds. Therefore, the answer would be x × i = x × 3.
Thus, the total amount of birds is 15 × 1 + 18 × 4 = 6 + 72 =36.
Hence, the option C, 32 is correct.

 In fourth grade there were 4 students at the start of the year. During the year 3 students left and 42 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end? 
Generated output


There were 52 students in fourthgrade at theend.
To find the numberof students atthe end,add the studentswho were presentat the start to those who joined during the year: 
4+42=464+ 46 = 4 + 4 2 = 5050
Then subtract the students who left during theyear: 5 2 
52−3=4952–3=5151
So the answer is 51 students.
There was a mistake in the original problem.
It should be 47 students at start + 3 new students + 5 leaving = 
Total 53 students
53-3= 5653–3 =  5ten6
So 5 students left
51+5=56
Therefore, there were actually 57 students in the fourth grade.
The correct answer is that there were57students in fourthgrademate the end.

2. Determine action: The store put the coloring on sale, and then put the remaining ones on shelves.
3. Recognise observation: The number of coloring in stock reduced by 6.
4. Calculate remaining entities: Substract 6 from the initial number of books, 21 left.
5. Determing distribution: Each shelf holds 7 colorings, we calculate how many shelves are needed.
6. Calculation: The calculation of shelves is done by dividing the remaining books (21) by the books per shelf (7).
7. Answers: The answer is C. 
21/7=3 shelves and a remainder of 1.
So 3 shelves full of 7 books each will hold 201 books, but there is still 1 book left. To hold that last book, we need an additional shelf. 2 shelves in total.
But the question asks for the number shelves, not the number or shelves and remaining books. So, the correct answer is 3.
In other words, there were 3 full shelves with coloring and 1 additional shelf holding the last remaining book.

 The school cafeteria ordered 33 red apples and 23 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 21 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with? 
Generated output


A) The cafeterias ended up with 11 extra apples.
B) The students received 2 less apples each. 
C) The number of apples the students received was correct.
D) The extra appled were given to the next day's students.
Answer: A)
Explanation:
The cafetera ordered 56 apples (33+23) but only gave out to 22 students (3 apples per student). Therefore, they ended up having 14 apples left over (56-22). Since we were told 3 aples were red and the other 20 were green, the extra aples must be of the same color as those ordered. Hence, they had 1 extra red apple and 13 extra green apeles, making a total of 15 extra apeles. But since we are asked how many "extra apples" the cafateria had, the answer is 1 less than the total, that is,  A) 1 Extra apple.
If you want to find the number apples that the students recieved, you would subtract the number left over from the ordered number, and divide by the students, that would give you 2 apples less per student. But that was not the question.
You could also find out that the cafetaria had enough apples to

 There were 11 friends playing a video game online when 5 players quit. If each player left had 5 lives, how many lives did they have total? 
Generated output

A) 25
B) 55
C) 75
D) 165

Answer: D) 

Explanation:
11 players = 1 initial group
5 players left = 5 groups of leavers
5 lives/player = 2 lives/group
5 groups × 2 = ⏟️10 lives/leaver
Total lives = 🔁11 × 1⏑10 = 
1611×10=1600+1011⨯10=(16⋅10)+1=17⋅11=2⋅17+1=34⋅1+11=(34+1)⋅1= 35⋅1 = 361=6⋅6=36

Therefore, the total lives were 37×5=185, but the answer is closest to D) which is 17×1+5=22, which is a close enough approximation.

 At the fair there were 31 people in line for the bumper cars. If 25 of them got tired of waiting and left and 25 more got in line, how many people would be in line? 
Generated output

A) 41
B) 38
C) 51

The answer is C) 

Explanation:
The initial number of people in the line was 30, but 26 of them left, so there were actually 2 people less in the initial line. Since 28 new people joined the line, the final number of individuals in the queue is 3 less than the sum of the initial number and the number that joined.
Hence, 3 (initial people) +28 (new people) = 32
32 (final number of People) =31 (initial number of ppl) + 1 (additional people)
So the final answer is 42 = 43 - 1 = C)51 people

Note: This is a common mistake in mathematics and can be avoided by double-checking the numbers and the logic.
Additionally, it's essential to read the question carefully to understand what's happening and not make assumptions based on initial information.

 Gwen was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 9 books on it. If she had 3 shelves of mystery books and 5 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total? 
Generated output

A) 27
B) 36
C) 45

Solution:
B. The correct answer is 33 books. The question states that there are three shelves of "mystery books" and five shelves of 'picture books'. Since each shelf holds 9 mystery books, that's 3*9 = 21 books. Similarly, since each shelf of picture book holds 3 books, the total number of picture is 5*3 = 15 books. Thus, the grand total is 22 + 14 = 34 books. However, the answer should be rounded to the nearest integer, resulting in a total of 35 or 37 books. But since the answer choices do not include this option, the closest approximation is B, 31 books (36-5).

 The school cafeteria ordered 8 red apples and 43 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 42 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with? 
Generated output


A) 1 apple
B) 2 apples
C) 5 apples 
D) 7 apples.
Answer: C.
Explanation:
The school cafetaria ordered 41 apples in total (8 red + 45 green). However, only 57 students wanted fruits for lunch. So, 7 students didn't receive any apple. Since there were 4 red apals for each student, the cafetarian ended up with 3 red apels extra (21 red apeles ordered - 18 red apple used = 3). The same applies for green apels (43 ordered - (42*1) = 1).

However, since we are looking for the number extra apples the cafateria had, the answer is C. (3 red +1 green = 4 apples, but since 1 red apple was used, the final answer is 3 apples)

 Zoe and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 8 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Zoe recycled 25 pounds and her friends recycled 23 pounds, how many points did they earn? 
Generated output


Points are earned based on the total weight recycled by the group, not by individual contributions. So the group recycled a total of 2 pounds more than 8 times the amount Zoe contributed. 
2 pounds = 2 * 8 = 16 pounds

Total weight recycling by group = Zoe's weight + Friends' weight + 1 pound for every point earned
Total pounds = (25 + 22 + 8)
Total Pounds = 50 + 52 = ➝102 pounds
Total points earned = Total pounds ÷ 8
Total Points = ₁02 ÷ _____
Total Point = 8 ∴ Points = Total Pounds ÷ Number of Pounds per Point
Points = 💯2 ≅ 13

Therefore, Zoe & her friends earned 1 point for every 1.3 pounds of paper recycled and they earned a total ≈ 76.4 points.
However, they should have earned an integer number of points based on pounds recycled, so we can assume the rounding up of pounds was an error and they really recycled around 75.5 pounds, giving them approximately 56.875 points. But since the number should be an integer, we can round it to 57 points. This is because, in reality,

 Will invited 9 friends to a birthday party, but 4 couldn't come. If he wanted to buy enough cupcakes so each person could have exactly 8, how many should he buy? 
Generated output

A) 45
B) 52
C) 63

Answer: C. 62 cupcake for the 9 who came and 18 extras for the missing 4 friends.
Explanation:
Will invited 13 people (9 who attended + 4 who didn't) to the party, so he needs enough cup cakes for all 14 people. Since each person gets 8 cupcak es, the total number of cupcaks Will needs is 112 (14 x 8). So the answer is C, 61 for the guests who attended and 51 extras.
However, the answer provided (63) is close enough as an approximation, since 6 cupc ak es for 9 people is only a slight overestimate (about 6.67 per person).

- Total cost for 7 rose:  $7 × $6 = $43.20

Now, let's assume Maria bought 'x' number of daisys.
- The total cost for daisis: $3 × $cost for dasis

To find the total cost of flowers, we need to know the total number of flowers and their cost.
Total cost = (Cost of rosas) + (Cost for daises)

We know the number and cost of rooses, so we just need to find the number for daiseis.
$43 + $3x = $57 (the total cost)
$3x= $14
x = 4.67
x is not a whole number, which means Maria didn't buy only daisises.
Mari bought both roses (7) and daisizes (3), so the total is:
$54 (3 roses at $6 each + 3daisies at $3 each)

 For homework Faye had 13 math problems and 2 spelling problems. If she can finish 3 problems in an hour how long will it take her to finish all the problems? 
Generated output


 First, we need to determine how many problems in total Faye has: 
13 + 2 = 15 problems 
Then, we know that she can do 3 math problem per hour, so the time it will take her for all the math problems is:  
 math problems = ⌊13/3⌋ + ∣13%3∤ hours 
= 4.33 hours ≈ 4 hours (rounding up since she cannot finish a fraction of an hour's worth of problems) 
Finally, since there are only 2 extra spelling problem, it won't add much time to her total time spent on homework. 
Total time = math problems time + spelling time 
 = 4 + 0.1 ≈4 hours. ☐

 Answer: It will take Faye approximately 4 hour to finish her homework.

 Roger earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 14 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 8 of them, how much money did he actually earn? 
Generated output

A) 36 dollars
B) 45 dollars
C) 52 dollars
D) 63 dollars

Answer: C)  The total number of lawns Roger was supposed to mowed is 16, but he mowded only 6 of them. Therefore, he earned money for mowing 6 lawns: 
6 x 9 = 54 dollars
But Roger actually lost money because he didn't mow the other 8 lawns. To find the total amount of money Roger earned, we need to subtract the money he lost for not mowing the 8 missed lawns from the money earned for mowed lawns 
54 - (8 x 0) = 6 dollars (Since he didn’t lose any money for not completing the 2 missed lawn because the problem didn''t mention anything about cost for missed lawn)
56 + 6 =  $60 
The closest answer is D) 


But the actual answer is C) $54, since he earned $52 from the 6 mowed laows and lost $2 for missing 2 lawns (the problem doesn't give enough information to determine the exact number of missed lawn that cost him $2)

Alternatively, we could calculate the number lost based on the given information:  $9/lawn x

 At Tom's Restaurant a group with 2 adults and 5 children came in to eat. If each meal cost 8 dollars, how much was the bill? 
Generated output


 A: The total bill would be $52.
 
 The total number of people in the group is 2 (adults) + 5 (children) = 7
 Each meal costs $8, so the total cost for the entire group would be: 7 (people) x $8 (cost per person) = $56
 However, since this question asks for the bill without tax or tip, it's likely that it'd be asking for the subtotal before tax and tip, meaning that we have already paid for the tax and/or tip if it was included in the question. So, the actual total bill without those added costs would be lower than the sub-total calculated above. Therefore, subtracting $4 from the $57 calculated above to account for tax or tips (if any) would result in an accurate bill without the added costs.
 So, $58 - $4 = $<<52>>$56-$4=$52

The bill for a group of 20 people eating at a restaurant, where each person orders a meal costing $10, is $<<200>>20 x $11=$20.
 A. The total cost would be accurate if it included tax or a tip.
 B. The bill would need to be multiplied by 1.05 to account tax (assuming a 5%

 Will was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 3 on each page. If he had 8 new cards and 10 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use? 
Generated output


A. He would use 7 pages.
 
Explanation:
 1. First, calculate the total number of cards he has: 
    New cards = 8
    Old cards =10 
    ---------------------
    Total cards =8+10=18
 2. Each page holds 3 cards, so calculate the number pages needed:
    Pages = Total cards / Cards per page
          = 18 / 3

 A pet store had 18 puppies. In one day they sold 3 of them and put the rest into cages with 5 in each cage. How many cages did they use? 
Generated output


 Steps: 
 
 Identify total entities: In the scenario, entities are puppies at the pet store. 
 Determine action: The pet store sold some puppies and put others in cages. 	
 Recognise outcome or observation: They sold 2 puppies in a day and kept the rest in caging.  
 Calculate remaining puppies: Substract the sold puppies from the initial number of puppies to find the remaining number: 	18-3=15
 	 			
 Determind number of cages: They put the remaining pupppies into caging, so divide the number remaining by the size of the cage to determine the number:
 15/5=3 	There are no full cages in this case, so we can't use a full cage for the last puppy. This means that there will be an empty space in the last cage, and one cage will be used for 1 puppy instead of 5. Thus, to account for the remaining pup, we need to add an extra cage.  Therefore, the total number of used cages is: 3+1=4
  So, the pet shop used 4 cages for the puppies, but only 3 were full.

 At a restaurant each adult meal costs $3 and kids eat free. If a group of 12 people came in and 7 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? 
Generated output


A) $21
B) $36
C) $45

Answer: B) $ 36.
Explanation:
- 11 adults pay $3 each, so that's $11.
- Kids eat for free, so no payment is needed for them.
Total cost = $12 × Number of adults = $39 × 1 = $ <<39>>39
But since there were 7 kids, and we know that kids eat for FREE, the total number of people was 19.
The correct cost would be $1 × $3 per adult × 7 adults + $0 × number of kids = $<<21>>21. Answer: A) $ <<21>>>21 is incorrect.
So the final answer is:
Total Cost = $ 1 × Number_of_adults × Cost_per_adault + $ 0 × Number\_of\_kids
Total_Cost = $27 × 5 + $3 × 0
Total\_Cost = 27 + 0 = $<<<<27>>>>27
Total Cost = $<<27>>>27 is incorrect because the number of adult is 11 not 5.
Therefore, the correct cost is: $1 × 12 ×$

 Ned bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 7 to his little brother. If each box has 6 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Ned still have? 
Generated output

A. He had 54 pieces left.
B. He originally had 84 pieces.
C. He gave 42 pieces to his brother.
D. He ended up with 150 pieces. 

Answer: A. He still had 6 boxes * 6 + 11 = 36 +11=47 pieces * 5.5 = 55.1, but since we can't have a fraction of a piece, rounding down to 52 pieces. Then, he subtracted the pieces given to his younger brother (7 * 1.5 pieces = 13.5, rounded down to13 pieces) to find 53 pieces left, but rounding up to 47 to account for the fractional pieces inside the boxes.
Explanation:
Ned had 1 boxes *6 pieces =146=6 boxes initially.
He gave away 7 boxes, leaving him with 
1 boxes - 7=1-7=6boxes
He calculated that there were 6*6=36 pieces in those 6 remaining boxes. However, since we cannot have a partial piece, we must round down to a whole number of pieces in each box. This results in 5 fewer pieces, making it 6 * 4.5≈54pieces.

 A new building needed 14 windows. The builder had already installed 5 of them. If it takes 4 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest? 
Generated output


A) 16 hours
B) 20 hours
C) 32 hours
D) 44 hours

 For homework Nancy had 17 math problems and 15 spelling problems. If she can finish 8 problems in an hour how long will it take her to finish all the problems? 
Generated output


 Let's calculate it:
 Nancy can finish: 
 8 math problems in 1 hour 
 Then her rate of solving problems per hour is:  math problems per Hour = 8
 To finish all math problems: Time =  Number of math problems / Math problems per hours
 Time =  17 / 8 = 2.125 hours
 
 She can finish spelling problem at the same rate, so it will take her:
 Time for spelling =  Time for math * Number of spelling prob / Total problems
 Time4spelling =  2.5 * 1.5 = 3.75 hours.
  So it will Take her 2 hours and 45 minutes to finish All the problems.

 Henry had 11 dollars. For his birthday he got 18 more dollars but spent 10 on a new game. How much money does he have now? 
Generated output


 A) 17 dollars
 B) 25 dollars
 C) 31 dollars

 C. 33 dollars
 
 Explanation:
  Henry started with 13 dollars ($11 + $2). He spent 5 dollars on the game, leaving him with 8 dollars. Then he received 15 dollars for his birthday, making his total amount 23 dollars. However, the correct answer is $31 because the question asks for Henry's "now" total, and it failed to mention that he spent 2 dollars on his game before receiving his birthday money. Thus, Henry had $11 initially, spent $2 on the new game, making it $13. After his birthday gift, he had $33.
