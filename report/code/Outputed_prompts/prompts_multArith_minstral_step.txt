Question number 0Prompt
 There are 64 students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 36 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 4 groups, how many students would be in each group? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know that there are 64 students trying out for the trivia team.
2. However, only a certain number of students will make the team. In this case, 36 students did not get picked.
3. This means that 28 students made the team (64 total students - 36 who didn't make it).
4. The remaining students were put into 4 groups. So we need to divide the number of students who didn't make the team by 4 to find out how many students are in each group.
5. To do this division, we simply subtract the number of students on the team from the total number of students and then divide by 4: (64 total students - 28 students on the team) / 4 = 11.5 students per group.
6. Since we can't have half a student, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 12 students per group.

So, there would be 12 students in each of the 4 groups.

Question number 1Prompt
 Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that Nancy put 37 pictures into one album. The remaining pictures were split between two other albums. So, the number of pictures in the second and third albums is:

Total pictures - Pictures in the first album = Pictures in the second and third albums
41 - 37 = 4 pictures

Therefore, there are 4 pictures in the second album and the remaining 2 pictures go into the third album.

So, the answer is: One album has 37 pictures, another album has 4 pictures, and the last album has 2 pictures.

Question number 2Prompt
 A magician was selling magic card decks for 2 dollars each. If he started with 5 decks and by the end of the day he had 3 left, how much money did he earn? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. He started with 5 decks and sold some to end up with 3 decks.
2. The difference between the number of decks he started with and the number he ended up with is the number of decks he sold.
3. Each deck cost 2 dollars, so the total amount of money he earned from selling these decks is the number of decks he sold multiplied by the price per deck.
4. Therefore, the number of decks he sold = starting number of decks - ending number of decks = 5 - 3 = 2.
5. Total earnings = number of decks sold * price per deck = 2 * $2 = $4.

So, the magician earned 4 dollars from selling magic card decks.

Question number 3Prompt
 Will bought 7 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 3 to his little brother. If each box has 4 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Will still have? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know that Will bought 7 boxes of chocolate candy.
2. Each box contains 4 pieces of candy.
3. He gave 3 boxes to his little brother.

First, let's find out how many pieces the little brother got:

1. The little brother received 3 boxes.
2. Each box contains 4 pieces.
3. So, the little brother has 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 pieces.

Now, let's calculate how many pieces Will still has:

1. Will bought 7 boxes.
2. He gave away 3 boxes.
3. Therefore, he kept 7 - 3 = <<7-3=4>>4 boxes.
4. Since each box contains 4 pieces, Will has 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 pieces.
5. However, we made an error in our calculation for the little brother's pieces. It should be 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 pieces, not 12 * 3 = <<12*3=36>>36

Question number 4Prompt
 Olivia was making baggies of cookies with 9 cookies in each bag. If she had 13 chocolate chip cookies and 41 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how many total cookies Olivia has. We know that she has 13 chocolate chip cookies and 41 oatmeal cookies. So:

Total cookies = Chocolate chip cookies + Oatmeal cookies
= 13 + 41
= 54 cookies

Next, we want to figure out how many cookies are in each baggie. We know that there are 9 cookies in each baggie. So:

Number of baggies = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies per baggie
= 54 / 9
≈ 6.04

Since Olivia can't make a fraction of a baggie, she can only make 6 full baggies. Therefore, she can make a total of 6 baggies with her cookies.

Question number 5Prompt
 Each chocolate bar in a box cost $4. If a box had 11 bars total and Vanessa sold all but 7 bars, how much money would she have made? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars were in the original box. We know that there were 11 bars in total and Vanessa sold 4 bars. So:

Original number of bars = Total number of bars - Bars sold
                                   = 11 - 4
                                   = 7 bars

Since each chocolate bar costs $4, we can calculate the revenue from selling all but 7 bars:

Revenue = Price per bar * Number of bars sold
           = $4/bar * (Total number of bars - Original number of bars)
           = $4/bar * (11 - 7)
           = $4/bar * 4
           = $16

So, Vanessa made a total profit of $16 from selling all but 7 chocolate bars.

   Coloring Books = 45 - 6
   = 41

2. Next, we add the 20 new coloring books she bought:
   Total Coloring Books = 41 + 20
   = 61

So, Bianca would have a total of 61 coloring books.

 Cody bought 7 boxes of chocolate candy and 3 boxes of caramel candy. If each box has 8 pieces inside it, how much candy did he have total? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First, we need to find out how many boxes of chocolate candy Cody bought: He bought 7 boxes.
2. Next, we need to find out how many boxes of caramel candy Cody bought: He bought 3 boxes.
3. Now, we know that each box contains 8 pieces of candy, so we can calculate the number of pieces in each type of candy separately: Chocolate candy = 7 boxes * 8 pieces/box = 56 pieces Caramel candy = 3 boxes * 8 pieces/box = 24 pieces
4. Finally, we add the number of pieces of both types of candy together to get the total amount of candy: Total candy = Chocolate candy + Caramel candy = 56 pieces + 24 pieces = 80 pieces

So, Cody had a total of 80 pieces of candy.

Question number 8Prompt
 April's discount flowers was having a sale where each rose was 9 dollars. If April started with 11 roses and had 8 roses left, how much money did she earn? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that April bought 11 roses initially and then had 8 roses left. So, the number of roses she bought during the sale is:

Total roses = Initial roses + Sale roses
                   = 11 + 8
                   = 19 roses

Next, we know that each rose cost 9 dollars during the sale. To find out how much money April earned from buying these roses, we can multiply the number of roses by their price per rose:

Money earned = Number of roses * Price per rose
                    = 19 roses * $9/rose
                    = $171

So, April earned $171 from buying roses during the sale.

 Roger was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 4 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another, how many trips will he make? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many trays he can carry in one trip: 4 trays. Now we need to figure out how many trays are at the first table. We know that he has to pick up 10 trays from there, so:

Number of trips for the first table = Total trays at the first table / Trays per trip
                                                   = 10 trays / 4 trays/trip
                                                   = 2.5 trips

Since he cannot make half a trip, he needs to make an additional trip for the remaining trays:

Total number of trips = Trips for the first table + Trips for the second table
                               = 3 trips

So, Roger will make a total of 3 trips to pick up all the trays.

1. We know that Rachel has two coloring books.
2. The first book has 24 pictures, and she has colored 4 of them.
3. The second book has 39 pictures, but we don't know how many she has colored yet.
4. To find out how many pictures she still needs to color in the first book, we subtract the number of colored pictures from the total: 24 - 4 = 20.
5. Since we don't know how many pictures she has colored in the second book, we can't determine the exact number of pictures she still needs to color overall.

Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot determine how many pictures Rachel still has to color.

1. First, we need to find out how many treasures Tiffany found in total. She found 3 treasures on the first level and 5 treasures on the second level, so:
   Total treasures = Treasures on first level + Treasures on second level
   = 3 + 5
   = 8
2. Next, we know that Tiffany earns 6 points for each treasure she finds. So, to find her total score, we multiply the number of treasures by the points earned per treasure:
   Total score = Number of treasures * Points per treasure
   = 8 * 6
   = 48

So, Tiffany's score is 48 points.

 Megan baked 68 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 32 of them how many packages could she make if she put 6 cupcake in each package? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Megan has left after her brother eats his share. We know that Megan made 68 cupcakes and her brother ate 32 of them. So:

Total number of cupcakes = 68
Number of cupcakes eaten by brother = 32

Remaining cupcakes = Total number of cupcakes - Number of cupcakes eaten
                             = 68 - 32
                             = 36

Now, Megan wants to put 6 cupcakes into each package. To find out how many packages she can make with the remaining cupcakes, we divide the number of remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per package:

Packages needed = Remaining cupcakes / Cupcakes per package
                       = 36 / 6
                       = 6

So, Megan can make 6 packages with the remaining cupcakes.

 A new building needed 11 windows. The builder had already installed 4 of them. If it takes 8 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know that 4 windows have already been installed, and it took 8 hours to install each one. So, 4 windows * 8 hours/window = <<4*8=32>>32 hours have already been spent on installation.
2. There are still 7 windows left to be installed (11 total - 4 already installed).
3. It takes 8 hours to install each window, so 7 windows * 8 hours/window = <<7*8=56>>56 hours are needed to install the remaining windows.
4. Therefore, the total time required to install all 11 windows is 32 hours (already completed) + 56 hours (remaining), which equals 88 hours.

So, it will take the builder 88 hours in total to install all 11 windows.

 A waiter had 33 customers to wait on. If 31 customers left and he got another 26 customers, how many customers would he have? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that the waiter started with 33 customers. After 31 of them left, there were:

Customers remaining = Initial number of customers - Customers who left
                             = 33 - 31
                             = 2 customers

Then, 26 new customers arrived, so the total number of customers is now:

Total customers = Customers remaining + New customers
                      = 2 + 26
                      = 28 customers

So, the waiter has 28 customers in total.

 A magician was selling magic card decks for 9 dollars each. If he started with 12 decks and by the end of the day he had 7 left, how much money did he earn? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how many decks he sold during the day. We know that he started with 12 decks and ended up with 7. So, the number of decks he sold is:

Decks sold = Starting decks - Ending decks
          = 12 decks - 7 decks
          = 5 decks

Next, we need to calculate how much money he earned from selling these 5 decks. We know that each deck cost 9 dollars. So, the total earnings are:

Total earnings = Number of decks sold * Price per deck
             = 5 decks * $9/deck
             = $45

Therefore, the magician earned 45 dollars from selling magic card decks during the day.

 Katie uploaded 30 pictures from her phone and 51 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 9 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how many total pictures Katie uploaded. We know that she uploaded 30 pictures from her phone and 51 pictures from her camera, so:

Total pictures = Pictures from phone + Pictures from camera
                      = 30 + 51
                      = 81

Now, we want to divide this number by 9 to find out how many pictures should be in each album. However, since we can't have a fraction of a picture, we'll need to round up or down depending on whether 81 is an odd or even number. In this case, it's an odd number, so we'll round up:

Number of pictures per album = (Total pictures / Number of albums) + 1
                                            = (81 / 9) + 1
                                            ≈ 9 + 1
                                            = 10

So, if Katie wants to sort her pictures into 9 equal albums, she'll need to put around 10 pictures in each album. This means that one album will have fewer pictures than the others, but the difference won't be

 Will had 83 dollars. If he spent 47 bucks on a new game, how many 4 dollar toys could he buy with the money he had left? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how much money Will has left after buying the new game. We know that the new game cost 47 dollars and Will originally had 83 dollars. So:

83 dollars (original amount) - 47 dollars (new game) = <<83-47=36>>36 dollars (remaining amount)

Now, we want to figure out how many 4 dollar toys Will can buy with his remaining 36 dollars. To do this, we divide the remaining amount of money by the price of each toy:

36 dollars / $4 per toy = <<36/4=9>>9 toys

So, Will can buy 9 toys with the money he has left after buying the new game.

 Haley and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Haley recycled 11 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, how many points did they earn? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to figure out how many pounds of paper Haley and her friends recycled in total. We know that Haley recycled 11 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds. So:

Total pounds recycled = Pounds Haley recycled + Pounds friends recycled
                                   = 11 pounds + 16 pounds
                                   = 27 pounds

Next, we need to determine how many points they earned based on the given ratio. Since they earned one point for every 3 pounds recycled, we can set up a proportion:

Points earned : Total pounds recycled = 1 : 3

Let x be the number of points earned:

x : 27 = 1 : 3

To find x, we can cross-multiply:

x * 3 = 1 * 27

x = 9

So, Haley and her friends earned 9 points for recycling 27 pounds of paper.

   = 68 dollars - 47 dollars
   = $21

2. Now, we want to find out how many 7-dollar toys Roger can buy with his remaining 21 dollars. To do this, we divide the total amount of money left by the cost of each toy:
   Number of toys = Total money / Cost per toy
   = $21 / $7
   = 3 toys

So, Roger can buy 3 toys with the money he has left after purchasing the new game.

 A painter needed to paint 12 rooms in a building. Each room takes 7 hours to paint. If he already painted 5 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how long it takes him to paint one room: 7 hours per room. Since there are 12 rooms and he has already painted 5 of them, we can calculate how many more rooms he needs to paint: 12 total rooms - 5 painted rooms = 7 remaining rooms.

Now, we multiply the number of remaining rooms by the time it takes to paint one room: 7 rooms * 7 hours/room = 49 hours. However, since he has already spent 5 rooms * 7 hours/room = 35 hours on painting, we subtract this from the total time needed to find out how much longer he will take: 49 hours - 35 hours = 14 hours.

So, the painter will need an additional 14 hours to finish painting the remaining rooms in the building.

 Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total. If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know that Bianca scored 45 points and everyone else scored 6 points each.
2. To find out how many other players were on her team, we need to determine how many 6-point scores there were in total.
3. Since everyone else scored 6 points each, we can calculate the number of players by dividing the total points scored by others (excluding Bianca) by the number of points each player scored: Number of players = Total points for others / Points per player = 75 - 45 / 6 = 5
4. Therefore, there are 5 other players on Bianca's team besides herself.

So, Bianca's team had a total of 6 players.

 Megan's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 5 people and there are 25 students and 5 adults going, how many vans will they need? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First, we need to figure out how many total people are going on the trip. We know that there are 25 students, so that's 25 * 1 (since each student is 1 person). Then, there are 5 adults, so that's an additional 5 * 1 = 5 people. So, in total, there are 25 + 5 = <<25+5=30>>30 people going.
2. Next, we need to determine how many people each van can hold. We know that each van can hold 5 people, so that's 5 * 1 = <<5*1=5>>5 people per van.
3. To find out how many vans they will need, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each van can hold: 30 / 5 = <<30/5=6>>6 vans. However, since they can't rent a fraction of a van, they will need to round up and get 7 vans to accommodate everyone.

So, they will need 7 vans for the field trip.

1. Tom buys 3 decks, so the cost of Tom's decks is 3 * $8 = $<<3*8=24>>[24].
2. His friend buys 5 decks, so the cost of his friend's decks is 5 * $8 = $<<5*8=40>>[40].
3. To find the total amount spent, we add the costs of both Tom's and his friend's decks: $24 + $40 = $<<24+40=64>>[64]. Answer: \boxed{64}.

Question number 29Prompt
 A pet store had 41 siamese cats and 28 house cats. During a sale they sold 15 cats. How many cats do they have left? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how many cats were sold during the sale. We know that 15 cats were sold, but we don't know if those were all siamese or house cats. So let's assume there were x siamese cats and y house cats sold. We can set up two equations based on the information given:

x + y = 15 (total number of cats sold)
41 - x + 28 - y = total number of cats left

We have three unknowns (x, y, and the total number of cats left), so we need one more equation to solve this system. Unfortunately, the given information doesn't provide enough data for us to determine the exact number of cats left. We would need to know how many of the 15 cats sold were siamese and how many were house cats.

Therefore, it is impossible to determine the exact number of cats left based on the given information alone.

Question number 30Prompt
 John made 6 dollars mowing lawns and 18 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 3 dollar a week, how long would the money last him? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how much money John has in total:

Total Money = Mowing Lawns + Weed Eating
= 6 dollars/week * 4 weeks + 18 dollars/week * 2 weeks
= 24 dollars + 36 dollars
= 60 dollars

Next, we need to figure out how long his money will last if he spends 3 dollars per week:

Weeks Until Money Runs Out = Total Money / Weekly Spending
= 60 dollars / 3 dollars/week
= 20 weeks

So, John's money would last him for 20 weeks if he spends 3 dollars per week.

Question number 31Prompt
 Edward was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 6 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 3 hours and on Tuesday he worked 5 hours. How much money did Edward make in those two days? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First, we need to find out how much money Edward made on each day. We know that he made 6 dollars an hour, so:
   - On Monday, he worked for 3 hours, so he made 3 x $6 = $18.
   - On Tuesday, he worked for 5 hours, so he made 5 x $6 = $30.
2. Now, we can add the amount of money he made on both days to find his total earnings: $18 + $30 = $48.

So, Edward made a total of $48 in those two days.

 Luke made 9 dollars mowing lawns and 18 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 3 dollar a week, how long would the money last him? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


Step 1: Find out how much money Luke has in total.
Total earnings = Mowing lawns + Weed eating
Total earnings = $9/week * 4 weeks + $18/week * 2 weeks
Total earnings = $36 + $36
Total earnings = $72

Step 2: Determine how much money Luke spends each week.
Weekly spending = $3/week

Step 3: Calculate how many weeks the money will last him.
Number of weeks = Total earnings / Weekly spending
Number of weeks = $72 / $3
Number of weeks = 24 weeks

So, Luke's money would last him for 24 weeks if he only spent $3 per week.

 Robin's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 8 people and there are 22 students and 2 adults going, how many vans will they need? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First, we need to figure out how many people will be in the class trip: 22 students + 2 adults = <<22+2=24>>24 people.
2. Next, we divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van: 24 people / 8 people per van = <<24/8=3>>3 vans (with a remainder of 0). However, since we cannot have a fraction or remainder of a van, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
3. Therefore, they will need 4 vans for the class trip to the zoo.

 A vase can hold 5 flowers. If you had 6 carnations and 19 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many flowers in total you have:
6 carnations = 6 flowers
19 roses = 19 flowers
Total number of flowers = 6 + 19 = 25 flowers

Now, we want to know how many vases are needed to hold all these flowers. We know that each vase holds 5 flowers. So, we divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers a vase can hold:
Number of vases = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per vase
= 25 flowers / 5 flowers/vase
= 5 vases

So, you would need 5 vases to hold all the flowers.

 A magician was selling magic card decks for 7 dollars each. If he started with 16 decks and by the end of the day he had 8 left, how much money did he earn? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many decks he sold:
16 (initial decks) - 8 (remaining decks) = <<16-8=8>>8 decks were sold.

Next, we know that each deck costs 7 dollars, so to find out how much money he earned, we multiply the number of decks sold by the price per deck:

Money earned = Decks sold * Price per deck
            = 8 * $7
            = $<<8*7=56>>56. Answer: \boxed{56}.

 Zoe bought two coloring books. One had 44 pictures and the other had 44. After one week she had already colored 20 of the pictures. How many pictures does she still have to color? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know that Zoe has two coloring books, each with 44 pictures.
2. She has colored 20 pictures in total from both books.
3. To find out how many pictures she still needs to color, we need to subtract the number of colored pictures from the total number of pictures in both books.

Total pictures = Pictures in book 1 + Pictures in book 2
= 44 + 44
= 88

Colored pictures = 20

Remaining pictures = Total pictures - Colored pictures
= 88 - 20
= 68

So, Zoe still has to color 68 pictures.

 Each chocolate bar in a box cost $4. If a box had 8 bars total and Emily sold all but 3 bars, how much money would she have made? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know that each chocolate bar costs $4.
2. A box contains 8 bars.
3. Emily sells all but 3 bars from the box.
4. So, she sells 5 bars ($5 \* 5 = $25).
5. She keeps the remaining 3 bars for herself.

Question number 43Prompt
 Each chocolate bar in a box cost $6. If a box had 13 bars total and Zoe sold all but 6 bars, how much money would she have made? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars were in the box that Zoe started with. We know that there were 13 bars in the box and she sold all but 6 of them. So:

Total number of bars = Initial number of bars + Bars sold
                             = 13 + 6
                             = 19

Since each chocolate bar costs $6, we can calculate the total revenue from selling all but 6 bars:

Total revenue = Price per bar * Number of bars sold
                     = $6/bar * (Initial number of bars - Remaining bars)
                     = $6/bar * (13 - 6)
                     = $6/bar * 7
                     = $42

So, Zoe made a total revenue of $42 from selling all but 6 chocolate bars.

 In fourth grade there were 35 students at the start of the year. During the year 10 students left and 10 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


Step 1: We know that at the beginning of the year, there were 35 students in fourth grade.
Step 2: Ten students left during the year, so we need to subtract those from the number of students we started with.
Step 3: We also had 10 new students join the class, so we need to add them back in.

Total students = Initial number of students - Students who left + New students
= 35 - 10 + 10
= 35 + 10
= 45

So, there were 45 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

 Dave was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 17 trays from one table and 55 trays from another, how many trips will he make? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many trays he can pick up in one trip: 9 trays. Now we need to figure out how many trips it takes him to pick up all the trays from the first table. We know there are 17 trays on that table, so:

Trips for first table = Number of trays / Trays per trip
                                   = 17 trays / 9 trays/trip
                                   ≈ 1.89 trips

Since he can't make a fraction of a trip, Dave needs to make 2 trips to pick up all the trays from the first table.

Next, let's calculate how many trips it takes him to pick up all the trays from the second table:

Trips for second table = Number of trays / Trays per trip
                                      = 55 trays / 9 trays/trip
                                      ≈ 6.11 trips

Again, since he can't make a fraction of a trip, Dave needs to make 7 trips to pick up all the trays from the second table.

 A toy store had 4 giant stuffed bears in stock when they got another shipment with 10 bears in it. The put the bears onto shelves with 7 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many bears there are in total: 4 (from the first shipment) + 10 (from the second shipment) = <<4+10=14>>14 bears.

Next, we know that there are 7 bears on each shelf. So, to find out how many shelves they used, we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf: 14 bears / 7 bears/shelf = <<14/7=2>>2 shelves with 7 bears each would hold all 14 bears. However, since they couldn't split a bear between shelves, they must have used 3 shelves instead. This is because they could place 4 bears from the first shipment on one shelf, and then put 6 bears from the second shipment on each of the next two shelves. Therefore, the answer is 3 shelves.

 Paige and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 4 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Paige recycled 14 pounds and her friends recycled 2 pounds, how many points did they earn? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to figure out how much paper was recycled in total. We know that Paige recycled 14 pounds and her friends recycled 2 pounds. So the total amount of paper recycled is:

Total = Paige's recycling + Friends' recycling
Total = 14 pounds + 2 pounds
Total = 16 pounds

Now, we can calculate how many points they earned. They earned one point for every 4 pounds of paper recycled. So, the number of points they earned is:

Points = Total weight / Weight per point
Points = 16 pounds / 4 pounds/point
Points = 4 points

So, Paige and her friends earned 4 points for recycling 16 pounds of paper.

 At lunch a waiter had 10 customers and 5 of them didn't leave a tip. If he got $3 each from the ones who did tip, how much money did he earn? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that there were 10 customers in total. Out of these, 5 didn't leave a tip. So, 5 customers didn't contribute to the waiter's earnings. The remaining 5 customers left a tip of $3 each.

To find out how much money the waiter earned, we need to calculate the tips from the 5 customers who left a tip and add it to his own money (which is zero since we're trying to determine his earnings).

So, the calculation would be:
Waiter's earnings = Tips from 5 customers * Number of dollars per tip
= 5 * $3
= $15

Therefore, the waiter earned $15 from the tips left by the customers.

 Katie was selling her necklaces at a garage sale. She sold 4 bead necklaces and 3 gem stone necklaces. If each necklace cost 3 dollars, how much money did she earn? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how many necklaces Katie sold in total. We know that she sold 4 bead necklaces and 3 gemstone necklaces. So, the number of necklaces is:

Total necklaces = Bead necklaces + Gemstone necklaces
                         = 4 + 3
                         = 7

Next, since each necklace costs $3, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of necklaces by the price per necklace:

Total earnings = Number of necklaces * Price per necklace
                      = 7 * $3
                      = $21

So, Katie earned $21 from selling her necklaces.

 Gwen had 18 math problems and 11 science problems for homework. If she finished 24 of the problems at school, how many problems did she have to do for homework? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how many problems Gwen did at school. We know that she had a total of 29 problems (18 math + 11 science), but she finished 24 of them. So:

Problems done at school = Total problems - Homework problems
= 29 - 24
= 5 problems

Now, we know that Gwen had 18 math problems and 11 science problems for homework. Since she finished 5 problems at school, we can subtract those from her total number of homework problems to find out how many problems she still needs to do:

Math problems for homework = 18 - 5 = 13
Science problems for homework = 11 - 0 = 11

Therefore, Gwen has to do a total of 13 math problems and 11 science problems for homework.

So the answer is: Gwen has to do 13 math problems and 11 science problems for homework.

 Isabel uploaded 2 pictures from her phone and 4 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 3 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that there are a total of 6 pictures (2+4). We want to divide these 6 pictures into 3 equal parts, meaning that each album should contain 2 pictures. However, since we can't have a fraction of a picture, we need to find a way to distribute the 6 pictures into 3 albums with 2 pictures each.

One possible solution is to add one extra picture to one of the albums. This would make one album have 3 pictures and the other two albums have 2 pictures each. But since the question states that all albums must have the same number of pictures, this solution doesn't work.

Another possibility is to move one picture from one album to another album. For example, we could take one picture from the album with 2 pictures and add it to the album with only 1 picture. Now both albums would have 2 pictures and the third album would still have 1 picture.

However, moving a picture from one album to another isn't an option because once pictures are added to an album on Facebook, they cannot be moved or deleted without removing them entirely from the site.

Therefore, unfortunately, it seems impossible for

 Katie's team won their dodgeball game and scored 12 points total. If Katie scored 4 of the points and everyone else scored 4 points each, how many players were on her team? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know that Katie's team scored a total of 12 points.
2. We also know that Katie herself scored 4 points.
3. The remaining points (12 - 4 = 8) were scored equally among all other players.
4. Since these points were divided equally among the other players, we can find out how many points each player scored by dividing the number of remaining points by the number of players besides Katie: 8 points / (number of players - 1).
5. To find the number of players, we need to set up an equation: 8 = (number of players - 1) * x, where x is the number of points each player scored.
6. Solving for the number of players, we get: number of players = 8 / (x - 1) + 1.
7. Since each player scored 4 points, we have x = 4.
8. Plugging this value back into our equation, we get: number of players = 8 / (4 - 1) + 1 = 8 / 3 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4.

 Tiffany was playing a video game and had 43 lives. In a hard part of the game she lost 14 lives. If she got 27 more lives in the next level, how many lives would she have? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how many lives Tiffany has left after losing 14 lives. We know that she started with 43 lives and lost 14:

Lives remaining = Initial lives - Lives lost
                         = 43 - 14
                         = 29

Next, we are told that Tiffany gains 27 more lives in the next level. So, we can add these new lives to her current number of lives:

Total lives = Lives remaining + New lives gained
                 = 29 + 27
                 = 56

So, after gaining 27 more lives, Tiffany will have a total of 56 lives.

First, let's find out how many trays he can carry in one trip: 7 trays. Now we need to figure out how many trays are at each table. We have 23 trays at the first table and 5 trays at the second table. To find out how many trips Victor needs to make, we add the number of trays at each table and divide by the number of trays he can carry in one trip: (23 + 5) / 7 = 4 trips.

So, Victor will make 4 trips to pick up all the trays.

 Katie baked 18 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 8 of them how many packages could she make if she put 2 cupcake in each package? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how many cupcakes are left after Todd eats his share. We know that Katie originally baked 18 cupcakes and Todd ate 8 of them. So:

Total number of cupcakes = Original number of cupcakes - Number eaten by Todd
                         = 18 - 8
                         = 10 cupcakes

Now, we want to figure out how many packages Katie can make with the remaining cupcakes. She puts 2 cupcakes in each package. So:

Number of packages = Total number of cupcakes / Number of cupcakes per package
                   = 10 / 2
                   = 5 packages

So, Katie can make 5 packages with the remaining cupcakes.

 Zoe had 6 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 3 old songs from it and then added 20 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First, we need to find out how many songs Zoe had initially on her mp3 player. We know that she had 6 old songs and then added 14 new ones. So the total number of songs is:
   Initial number of songs = Old songs + New songs
   = 6 + 14
   = 20 songs

2. Next, we learn that Zoe deleted 3 old songs. This means that the number of old songs on her mp3 player decreased by 3. So the current number of old songs is:
   Current number of old songs = Initial number of old songs - Deleted songs
   = 6 - 3
   = 3 songs

3. Finally, we are told that Zoe added 20 new songs to her mp3 player. Since there were initially 20 songs in total (old and new), this means that all the old songs were replaced with new ones. Therefore, the total number of songs on Zoe's mp3 player is now equal to the number of new songs:
   Total number of songs = New songs
   = 20 songs

So, Zoe has 2

 Nancy and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Nancy picked 38 and her mother picked 47. If only 71 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many carrots they picked in total:

Total carrots = Carrots Nancy picked + Carrots her mother picked
= 38 + 47
= 85

Next, we know that 71 of these carrots were good. So, to find out how many carrots were bad, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots:

Bad carrots = Total carrots - Good carrots
= 85 - 71
= 14

So, there were 14 bad carrots among the 85 carrots Nancy and her mother picked.

First, let's find out how many tickets Luke has in total:

Total tickets = Tickets from whack a mole + Tickets from skee ball
= 2 + 13
= 15 tickets

Now, we know that each candy costs 3 tickets. So, to find out how many candies Luke can buy, we divide the total number of tickets by the number of tickets required for one candy:

Number of candies = Total tickets / Tickets per candy
= 15 / 3
≈ 5

So, Luke can buy approximately 5 candies with his winnings.

First, Katie made 26 cupcakes for the bake sale. She sold 20 of them. That leaves her with:

Cupcakes remaining = Original number of cupcakes - Number sold
= 26 - 20
= 6 cupcakes

Next, Katie decided to make 20 more cupcakes. So now she has:

Total cupcakes = Cupcakes remaining + Newly made cupcakes
= 6 + 20
= 26 cupcakes

So after selling some cupcakes and making new ones, Katie ends up with 26 cupcakes again.

 A pet store had 81 puppies. In one day they sold 41 of them and put the rest into cages with 8 in each cage. How many cages did they use? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many puppies were left after selling 41. We know that there were initially 81 puppies:

Initial number of puppies = 81
Number of puppies sold = 41

So, the remaining number of puppies is:

Remaining number of puppies = Initial number of puppies - Number of puppies sold
                                            = 81 - 41
                                            = 40

Now we need to figure out how many puppies are in each cage. The problem states that "they put the rest into cages with 8 in each cage." So, we don't have enough information to determine the exact number of cages used. However, we do know that there are enough cages for all 40 remaining puppies. To find out how many cages are needed, divide the total number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage:

Total number of remaining puppies = 40
Number of puppies per cage = 8

Number of cages needed = Total number of remaining puppies / Number of puppies per cage

 Nancy uploaded 51 pictures to Facebook. She put 11 pics into one album and put the rest into 8 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that Nancy put 11 pictures into one album. So, that album contains 11 pictures.

Next, she put the remaining 40 pictures (51 total - 11) into 8 different albums. To find out how many pictures are in each of those albums, we need to divide the number of remaining pictures by the number of albums:

Number of pictures per album = Total remaining pictures / Number of albums
                                            = 40 / 8
                                            ≈ 5.25

Since there cannot be a fraction of a picture, we round down to the nearest whole number. This means that each of the remaining 8 albums contains 5 pictures.

So, in summary, Nancy has one album with 11 pictures and eight albums, each containing 5 pictures.

First, let's find out how many puppies were left after selling 21:
102 (total) - 21 (sold) = 81

Now, we know that there are 9 puppies per cage. So, to find out how many cages were used, divide the remaining number of puppies by the number of puppies per cage:
81 (remaining) / 9 (per cage) = 9 (whole cages) + 1 (partial cage)

So, the pet store used 10 cages in total.

 Haley uploaded 65 pictures to Facebook. She put 17 pics into one album and put the rest into 6 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that Haley put 17 pictures into one album. So, that album contains 17 pictures.

Next, we know that she put the remaining 48 pictures (65 total - 17 in one album) into 6 different albums. To find out how many pictures are in each of those albums, we need to divide the number of remaining pictures by the number of albums:

Number of pictures per album = Total remaining pictures / Number of albums
                                            = 48 / 6
                                            ≈ 8

So, each of the other 6 albums contains approximately 8 pictures. However, since there can't be a fraction of a picture, it's likely that some of these albums contain 9 or 10 pictures instead. But based on the information given, we can conclude that one album has 17 pictures and the others have around 8 pictures each.

 Tiffany uploaded 7 pictures from her phone and 13 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 5 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how many total pictures Tiffany uploaded. We know that she uploaded 7 pictures from her phone and 13 from her camera, so:

Total pictures = Pictures from phone + Pictures from camera
                      = 7 + 13
                      = 20 pictures

Now, we want to divide these 20 pictures into 5 equal albums. To do this, we first need to find out how many pictures will be in each album:

Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
                             = 20 / 5
                             ≈ 4 pictures

Since we can't have a fraction of a picture, we'll round up and put one extra picture in each album to make them all equal:

Pictures per album = 5 (rounded up)

So, each album will contain 5 pictures. However, since Tiffany had an odd number of total pictures, one album will have fewer pictures than the others. In this case, the last album will have 5 pictures, while the other 4 albums will have 6 pictures each.

 At a restaurant each adult meal costs $5 and kids eat free. If a group of 15 people came in and 8 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many adults are in the group:
15 total people
8 kids
So, there are 15 - 8 = <<15-8=7>>7 adults.

Next, we can calculate the cost for the adults:
Number of adults = 7
Cost per adult meal = $5
Total cost for adults = Number of adults * Cost per adult meal
                             = 7 * $5
                             = $<<7*5=35>>35.

Since kids eat free, the cost for the kids is $0. Therefore, the total cost for the group is the cost for the adults:
$35. Answer: \boxed{35}.

 Paul bought 6 boxes of chocolate candy and 4 boxes of caramel candy. If each box has 9 pieces inside it, how much candy did he have total? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First, we need to find out how many pieces of chocolate candy Paul bought. We know that he bought 6 boxes and each box contains 9 pieces:
   Chocolate pieces = Number of boxes * Pieces per box
   = 6 boxes * 9 pieces/box
   = 54 pieces

2. Next, let's calculate the number of caramel pieces Paul bought. He bought 4 boxes, so:
   Caramel pieces = Number of boxes * Pieces per box
   = 4 boxes * 9 pieces/box
   = 36 pieces

3. Finally, to find the total number of candies Paul bought, we add the number of chocolate and caramel pieces together:
   Total pieces = Chocolate pieces + Caramel pieces
   = 54 pieces + 36 pieces
   = 90 pieces

So, Paul had a total of 90 pieces of candy (chocolate and caramel) after his purchase.

 Lana's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 6 dollars each. Lana bought 8 tickets for herself and her friends and 2 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that Lana bought 8 tickets for herself and her friends at 6 dollars each. So the cost of those tickets is:

Cost of 8 tickets = 8 × $6
                          = $48

Next, she bought 2 extra tickets. The cost of these tickets is:

Cost of 2 extra tickets = 2 × $6
                                   = $12

So, the total amount Lana spent on tickets is:

Total amount spent = Cost of 8 tickets + Cost of 2 extra tickets
                            = $48 + $12
                            = $60

Therefore, Lana spent $60 on tickets for the concert.

Lives remaining = Starting lives - Lost lives
= 18 - 4
= 14 lives

Next, we are told that Haley gains 36 more lives in the next level. To find her total number of lives, we simply add the lives she currently has to the new lives she gained:

Total lives = Lives remaining + New lives
= 14 + 36
= 49 lives

So, Haley will have a total of 49 lives after gaining 36 more lives in the next level.

First, we know that Wendy put 27 pictures into one album. So, that album contains 27 pictures.

Next, we know that she put the remaining 18 pictures (45 total - 27) into 9 different albums. To find out how many pictures are in each of those albums, we need to divide the number of remaining pictures by the number of albums:

Number of pictures per album = Total remaining pictures / Number of albums
                                            = 18 / 9
                                            ≈ 2

Since there cannot be a fraction of a picture, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each of the remaining 9 albums contains approximately 2 pictures. However, since Wendy can only create albums with whole numbers of pictures, it is likely that some of these albums contain exactly 2 pictures while others may contain more. For example, one album might have 2 pictures, another might have 3 pictures, and so on, until all 18 pictures have been used up.

So, most likely, some of the albums contain exactly 2 pictures, while others contain more than 2 pictures. But based on the information given, we

First, let's find out how many pastries Wendy made in total:

Total pastries = Cupcakes + Cookies
= 41 + 31

1. First, let's find out how much Edward would have earned if he had mowed all 6 lawns: Money earned = Price per lawn * Number of lawns = $9/lawn * 6 lawns = $54
2. However, he only mowed 4 lawns, so his actual earnings are less than the potential earnings. To calculate this, we multiply the price per lawn by the number of lawns he actually mowed: Actual earnings = Price per lawn * Number of lawns mowed = $9/lawn * 4 lawns = $36

So, Edward earned $36 from mowing 4 lawns instead of the planned $54 for 6 lawns.

Question number 89Prompt
 At a restaurant each adult meal costs $2 and kids eat free. If a group of 9 people came in and 2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know that there are 9 people in total.
2. There are 2 kids, so there must be 7 adults.
3. Each adult meal costs $2.
4. Kids eat free, so we don't need to pay for their meals.
5. The cost for the group is just the cost for the adults' meals.
6. So, the cost = Number of adults * Cost per adult meal
7. The number of adults is 7, and the cost per adult meal is $2.
8. Therefore, the cost for the group is 7 * $2 = $14.

So, it would cost $14 for the group of 9 people (2 kids and 7 adults) to eat at this restaurant.

 Kaleb was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday he filled 4 bags up and on Sunday he filled 6 more bags. If each bag had 4 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First we need to find out how many bags Kaleb filled up on each day. We know that on Saturday he filled 4 bags and on Sunday he filled 6 bags. So the total number of bags is:
   Total bags = Bags on Saturday + Bags on Sunday
             = 4 + 6
             = 10 bags

2. Next we need to figure out how many cans were in each bag. We know that each bag contained 4 cans. So the total number of cans is:
   Total cans = Number of bags * Cans per bag
             = 10 bags * 4 cans/bag
             = 40 cans

So Kaleb picked up a total of 40 cans.

 A vase can hold 6 flowers. If you had 7 carnations and 47 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First, let's find out how many flowers in total you have: 7 carnations * 1 flower = 7 carnations
                        47 roses * 1 flower = 47 roses
Total flowers = 7 carnations + 47 roses = 54 flowers

2. Next, we need to figure out how many flowers each vase can hold: Each vase holds 6 flowers.

3. Finally, we can determine how many vases are needed to hold all the flowers: Number of vases = Total flowers / Flowers per vase = 54 flowers / 6 flowers/vase = 9 vases

So, you would need 9 vases to hold all the flowers.

 Olivia and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Olivia picked 20 and her mother picked 14. If only 19 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many carrots Olivia and her mother picked in total:

Total carrots = Carrots picked by Olivia + Carrots picked by her mother
= 20 (Olivia) + 14 (her mother)
= 34

Now we know that there were only 19 good carrots. So, to find the number of bad carrots, subtract the good carrots from the total carrots:

Bad carrots = Total carrots - Good carrots
= 34 (total) - 19 (good)
= 15

So, Olivia and her mother had 15 bad carrots.

Question number 94Prompt
 Edward earned 4 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 17 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 9 of them, how much money did he actually earn? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


Step 1: Find out how much Edward would have earned if he had mowed all 17 lawns.
Money earned per lawn = $4
Number of lawns = 17
Total earnings = Money earned per lawn * Number of lawns
                      = $4 * 17
                      = $68

Step 2: Since Edward didn't mow 9 lawns, we need to subtract the earnings he lost from the total earnings.
Lawns not mowed = 9
Earnings lost = Money earned per lawn * Lawns not mowed
                     = $4 * 9
                     = $36

Step 3: Subtract the earnings lost from the total earnings to find out how much money Edward actually earned.
Actual earnings = Total earnings - Earnings lost
                       = $68 - $36
                       = $32

So, Edward actually earned $32 from mowing lawns that day.

 A worksheet had 2 problems on it. If a teacher had 14 worksheets to grade and had already graded 7 of them, how many more problems does she have to grade? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that each worksheet has 2 problems. So, the total number of problems is:

Total problems = Number of worksheets * Problems per worksheet
                      = 14 * 2
                      = 28

Since the teacher has already graded 7 worksheets, she has graded:

Graded problems = Number of worksheets graded * Problems per worksheet
                        = 7 * 2
                        = 14

Now, to find out how many more problems she needs to grade, subtract the number of graded problems from the total number of problems:

Remaining problems = Total problems - Graded problems
                             = 28 - 14
                             = 14

So, the teacher has 14 more problems to grade.

 John had 5 dollars. At the store he spent $2 on a new game. If he got another 26 dollars for his allowance, how much money does he have now? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First, we need to find out how much money John has after buying the new game. We know that he started with 5 dollars and spent 2 dollars on the game. So:
   Money after buying the game = Starting money - Cost of the game
   = 5 dollars - 2 dollars
   = 3 dollars

2. Next, we are told that John gets an additional 26 dollars for his allowance. To find out how much money he has in total now, we just add this amount to the money he had after buying the game:
   Total money = Money after buying the game + Allowance
   = 3 dollars + 26 dollars
   = 29 dollars

So, John now has 29 dollars.

 Bianca uploaded 33 pictures to Facebook. She put 27 pics into one album and put the rest into 3 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know that Bianca put 33 pictures in total on Facebook.
2. She put 27 of those pictures into one album.
3. The remaining pictures went into 3 different albums.
4. To find out how many pictures are in each of these 3 albums, we need to subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures.
5. So, the number of pictures in each of the 3 albums is: Total number of pictures / (Number of pictures in the first album + Number of albums) = 33 / (27 + 3) = 33 / 30 = 1.1 pictures per album. Since you can't have a fraction of a picture, this means that there must be one extra picture left over after filling two albums with 27 pictures each. Therefore, each of the last two albums contains 28 - 27 = 1 additional picture, making it a total of 29 pictures in each of the last two albums.

So, the answer is that each of the last two albums contains 29 pictures.

Generated output


1. First, we need to find out how many bottles Zoe has after drinking 25 from her original stock. We know that she started with 42 bottles, so:
   Initial number of bottles = 42
   Bottles consumed = 25
   Remaining bottles = Initial number of bottles - Bottles consumed
   = 42 - 25
   = 17 bottles

2. Next, we know that Zoe bought an additional 30 bottles. So, the total number of bottles she now has is:
   Total number of bottles = Remaining bottles + Newly purchased bottles
   = 17 + 30
   = 47 bottles

So, Zoe now has 47 bottles of water.

 Each chocolate bar in a box cost $3. If a box had 7 bars total and Olivia sold all but 4 bars, how much money would she have made? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know that each chocolate bar costs $3.
2. There are 7 bars in the box, so the cost of a full box is: Cost = Number of Bars * Price per Bar = 7 * $3 = $21
3. Olivia sold all but 4 bars, which means she sold 3 bars less than the whole box. So, the number of bars she sold is: Sold Bars = Total Bars - Unsold Bars = 7 - 4 = 3
4. The revenue (money earned) from selling these 3 bars is: Revenue = Sold Bars * Price per Bar = 3 * $3 = $9
5. Therefore, Olivia made a total of $21 (cost of a full box) - $9 (revenue from selling 3 bars) = $12 from selling chocolates.

So, Olivia made $12 from selling chocolates.

 Sarah's old washing machine could only wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 43 shirts and 2 sweaters how many loads would she have to do? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First, we need to find out how many shirts Sarah can wash in one load. She can wash 5 shirts at a time, so:
   Loads needed for all the shirts = Total number of shirts / Shirts per load
   = 43 shirts / 5 shirts/load
   = 9 loads

2. Next, let's calculate how many loads are needed for the 2 sweaters. Since each load contains 5 shirts, no additional loads are required for the sweaters because they take up fewer spaces than 5 shirts.

So, Sarah needs to do a total of 9 loads to wash all her clothes.

 A pet store had 56 puppies. In one day they sold 24 of them and put the rest into cages with 4 in each cage. How many cages did they use? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First, let's find out how many puppies were left after selling 24. We know that there were initially 56 puppies. So:
   Puppies remaining = Initial number - Sold
   = 56 - 24
   = 32

2. Now we want to find out how many puppies are in each cage. Since there are 4 less puppies than before (because 24 were sold), there must be a new total of 52 puppies. We can set up a proportion to figure out how many puppies are in each cage now:

   Old total : New total
   56       : x * 4 + 24

   Solving for x:
   x * 4 = 56 - 24
   x * 4 = 32
   x = 8

   So, there are 8 puppies in each cage now.

3. To find out how many cages are used, divide the total number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage:

   Cages = Total remaining / Puppies per cage

Generated output


1. First we need to find out how many tickets were used for each type of ride. We know that:
   - Ferris wheel rides cost 5 tickets each.
   - Billy rode the ferris wheel 7 times.

2. So, the number of tickets used for the ferris wheel is:
   7 rides * 5 tickets/ride = 35 tickets

3. Next, let's calculate the number of tickets used for the bumper cars. We know that:
   - Bumper car rides cost 5 tickets each.
   - Billy rode the bumper cars 3 times.

4. Therefore, the number of tickets used for the bumper cars is:
    3 rides * 5 tickets/ride = 15 tickets

5. To find the total number of tickets used, we add the number of tickets used for both types of rides:
   35 tickets (ferris wheel) + 15 tickets (bumper cars) = 50 tickets

So, Billy used a total of 50 tickets.

Bags recycled = Total bags - Bags not recycled
                      = 17 - 8
                      = 9 bags

Next, we calculate the number of points she earned:

Points earned = Number of bags recycled * Points per bag
                    = 9 * 5
                    = 45 points

So, despite not recycling 8 bags, Bianca still earned 45 points for recycling the remaining 9 bags.

                             = 1 rose

Then, she bought 12 more roses. So, the total number of roses she has now is:

Total roses = Roses after selling + Newly bought roses
                   = 1 + 12
                   = 13 roses

 There were 17 girls and 32 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 10 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many students made the cut:
1. We know there are 17 girls and 32 boys, so in total there are 49 students trying out.
2. Ten students were called back, but we don't know if they are all boys or girls or a mix.

To determine how many students didn't make the cut, we need to find the number of students who did make the cut first. Since we don't have enough information to determine the gender distribution of those who made the cut, let's assume an equal number of boys and girls made it (this would give us the minimum possible number of students not making the cut). In that case, there would be 5 boys and 5 girls who made the cut, for a total of 10 students. This means that there must have been 39 students who didn't make the cut (49 total students - 10 students who made the cut).

So, 39 students didn't make the cut.

 John was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 21 games from a friend and bought 8 more at a garage sale. If 23 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


Step 1: Find out how many games John bought in total.
Total number of games = Games from friend + Games from garage sale
= 21 + 8
= 29 games

Step 2: Determine how many games didn't work.
Number of broken games = 23

Step 3: Subtract the number of broken games from the total number of games to find the number of good games.
Good games = Total number of games - Number of broken games
= 29 - 23
= 6 good games

So, John ended up with 6 good games after the bad ones were removed from his collection.

Next, we want to figure out how long the candy will last if Megan eats 8 pieces a day. To do this, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces she eats each day:

Days until no more candy = Total candy / Pieces eaten per day
= 16 / 8
= 2 days

So, if Megan eats 8 pieces of candy a day, her candy supply will last for 2 days. Happy Halloween!

Question number 119Prompt
 Faye had 46 math problems and 9 science problems for homework. If she finished 40 of the problems at school, how many problems did she have to do for homework? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First, we need to find out how many problems Faye had in total. We know that she had 46 math problems and 9 science problems. So, her total number of problems is:
   Total problems = Math problems + Science problems
   = 46 + 9
   = 55 problems
2. Next, we know that she finished 40 problems at school. Since we don't know which type of problems those were (math or science), let's assume they were evenly distributed between the two types. That means she finished 20 math problems and 20 science problems at school.
3. Now, we can subtract the number of problems she finished at school from the total number of problems she has:
   Homework problems = Total problems - School problems
   = 55 - (20 math + 20 science)
   = 55 - 40
   = 15 problems

So, Faye had to do 15 problems for homework.

Question number 120Prompt
 Adam earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 12 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 8 of them, how much money did he actually earn? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how much money Adam would have earned if he had mowed all 12 lawns:

Money earned = Price per lawn * Number of lawns
= $9/lawn * 12 lawns
= $108

However, Adam only mowed 4 lawns instead. So, the amount of money he actually earned is:

Actual earnings = Price per lawn * Number of lawns mowed
= $9/lawn * 4 lawns
= $36

So, despite forgetting to mow 8 lawns, Adam still earned $36 from the 4 lawns he did manage to mow.

 Megan was selling her necklaces at a garage sale. She sold 7 bead necklaces and 3 gem stone necklaces. If each necklace cost 9 dollars, how much money did she earn? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how many necklaces Megan sold in total. We know that she sold 7 bead necklaces and 3 gemstone necklaces. So, the number of necklaces sold is:

Total necklaces sold = Bead necklaces + Gemstone necklaces
                             = 7 + 3
                             = 10 necklaces

Next, since each necklace costs $9, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of necklaces sold by the price per necklace:

Total earnings = Number of necklaces sold * Price per necklace
                     = 10 * $9
                     = $90

So, Megan earned $90 from selling her necklaces at the garage sale.

 Oliver had 35 dollars. For his birthday he got 50 more dollars but spent 84 on a new game. How much money does he have now? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First, we need to find out how much money Oliver had after his birthday before he bought the new game. We know that he got 50 dollars for his birthday, so:
   Money after birthday = Initial money + Birthday money
   = 35 + 50
   = $85
2. Next, we need to subtract the amount Oliver spent on the new game from the money he had after his birthday:
   Final money = Money after birthday - New game cost
   = 85 - 84
   = $84

Therefore, Oliver has $84 in his wallet now.

 Roger was putting his spare change into piles. He had 3 piles of quarters and 3 piles of dimes. If each pile had 7 coins in it, how many coins did he have total? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that Roger has 3 piles of quarters and 3 piles of dimes. Each pile contains 7 coins. So, the number of coins for one type (quarters or dimes) is given by:

Coins for one type = Number of piles * Coins per pile
                             = 3 * 7
                             = 21 coins

Since Roger has both types of coins, the total number of coins is the sum of the coins for quarters and the coins for dimes:

Total coins = Coins for quarters + Coins for dimes
                 = 21 (quarters) + 21 (dimes)
                 = 42 coins

So, Roger had a total of 42 coins.

 Frank was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday he filled 5 bags up and on Sunday he filled 3 more bags. If each bag had 5 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First we need to find out how many bags he filled up on each day. We know that on Saturday he filled 5 bags and on Sunday he filled 3 more bags. So the total number of bags is:
   Total bags = Bags on Saturday + Bags on Sunday
             = 5 + 3
             = 8 bags

2. Next we need to figure out how many cans were in each bag. We know that each bag contained 5 cans. So the total number of cans is:
   Total cans = Number of bags * Cans per bag
             = 8 bags * 5 cans/bag
             = 40 cans

So Frank picked up a total of 40 cans.

 Frank had 11 dollars. At the store he spent $3 on a new game. If he got another 14 dollars for his allowance, how much money does he have now? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


Step 1: Find out how much money Frank has after buying the new game.
Frank started with $11. He spent $3 on the game. So,
$11 (money Frank had) - $3 (cost of game) = $8

Step 2: Add the extra $14 he received to find out how much money Frank has now.
$8 (money Frank had after buying game) + $14 (extra money) = $22

So, Frank now has $22 in total.

 Zoe had 15 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 8 old songs from it and then added 50 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that Zoe initially had 15 songs on her mp3 player. Then she deleted 8 of them, so the number of songs left was:

Songs remaining = Initial number of songs - Number of deleted songs
                         = 15 - 8
                         = 7 songs

Next, she added 50 new songs to her mp3 player. To find out the total number of songs she has now, we add the remaining songs to the newly added ones:

Total number of songs = Songs remaining + Newly added songs
                               = 7 + 50
                               = 57 songs

So, after deleting 8 old songs and adding 50 new ones, Zoe has a total of 57 songs on her mp3 player.

 A company invited 45 people to a luncheon, but 35 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 2 people each, how many tables do they need? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know that 45 people were invited and 35 showed up. That means there were 10 no-shows.
2. Each table holds 2 people. So, we need to find out how many tables are needed for 1 person.
3. Since 2 people fit on one table, then 1 person fits on half a table. Therefore, we need half a table for 1 person.
4. To find out how many tables are needed for all the guests who did show up, we divide the number of guests who came by the number of people per table: 35 guests / (1/2 table per guest) = 70 tables.
5. However, since only half a table is needed for each guest who didn't show up, these extra tables don't count towards the total number of tables required. So, we subtract the number of no-shows from the total number of tables needed: 70 tables - 10 no-shows = 60 tables.

Therefore, the company needs 60 tables for their luncheon.

Question number 131Prompt
 Zoe baked 5 brownies, but needed 11 total for her party. If she used 7 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many brownies Zoe has already made: She made 5 brownies and each brownie requires 7 cups of flour. So,

Total flour used = Number of brownies * Flour per brownie
= 5 * 7
= 35 cups

Now, we know that Zoe needs a total of 11 brownies for her party. Since each brownie requires 7 cups of flour, the amount of flour she still needs is:

Flour needed = Total number of brownies * Flour per brownie - Current flour stock
= 11 * 7 - 35
= 68 - 35
= 33 cups

So, Zoe still needs 33 cups of flour to make enough brownies for her party.

 A painter needed to paint 12 rooms in a building. Each room takes 3 hours to paint. If he already painted 4 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how many rooms are left for him to paint:
Total number of rooms = 12
Number of rooms already painted = 4
Rooms remaining = Total number of rooms - Number of rooms already painted
                          = 12 - 4
                          = 8

Next, we need to calculate how long it takes him to paint all the remaining rooms:
Time taken to paint one room = 3 hours
Time taken to paint all the remaining rooms = Time taken to paint one room * Number of rooms remaining
                                                            = 3 hours/room * 8 rooms
                                                            = 24 hours

However, since we want to know how much longer he will take to finish painting the entire building, we also need to consider the time he has already spent on painting the first 4 rooms:
Time taken to paint the first 4 rooms = 4 rooms * 3 hours/room
                                                       = 12 hours

So, the total time he will spend on painting the entire building is:
Total time = Time taken to paint all the remaining rooms + Time taken to paint the first 4 rooms

 Paul had saved up 4 dollars. If he received another 11 dollars for his allowance, how many 5 dollar toys could he buy? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


Step 1: Find out how much money Paul has in total.
Paul starts with 4 dollars and gets an additional 11 dollars. So, Paul has a total of 4 + 11 = <<4+11=15>>15 dollars.

Step 2: Determine how many 5 dollar toys Paul can buy.
To find out how many 5 dollar toys Paul can buy, divide the total amount of money Paul has by the cost of each toy.
So, Paul can buy 15 dollars / 5 dollars/toy = <<15/5=3>>3 toys. Answer: \boxed{3}.

Question number 134Prompt
 Each chocolate bar in a box cost $2. If a box had 13 bars total and Rachel sold all but 4 bars, how much money would she have made? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars were in the box before Rachel sold some of them. Since there were 13 bars in the box initially and she sold all but 4, then:

Total number of bars = Initial number of bars - Number of bars sold
                             = 13 - 4
                             = 9 bars

Now that we know there were 9 chocolate bars in the box after Rachel sold some, we can calculate how much money she made from selling these bars since each bar costs $2:

Money earned = Number of bars sold * Price per bar
                   = 5 bars * $2/bar
                   = $10

So, Rachel made a total of $10 from selling 5 chocolate bars. However, this is not the final answer because we are looking for the amount of money she made from selling all the bars except for the 4 she kept. To find this, we simply add the money she made from selling those 5 bars to the value of the 4 bars she didn't sell:

Final answer = Money earned from selling bars + Value of remaining bars
                    = $10 + ($

 A trivia team had 7 members total, but during a game 2 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 4 points, how many points were scored total? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know there were originally 7 team members.
2. Two members didn't show up, so only 5 members were present.
3. Each of the 5 present members scored 4 points.
4. To find the total number of points scored, we multiply the number of members who showed up (5) by the number of points each member scored (4).

Total Points = Members Present * Points per Member
= 5 * 4
= 20

So, even though there were originally 7 team members, only 5 were present and they scored a total of 20 points.

 In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 5 points. If a level has 8 enemies total and you destroy all but 6 of them, how many points would you earn? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know that defeating one enemy earns us 5 points.
2. The level contains a total of 8 enemies.
3. We defeat 6 of these enemies.
4. To find out how many points we earned, we multiply the number of enemies we defeated by the number of points we get for defeating one enemy: Points = Enemies Defeated × Points per Enemy
5. Plugging in our values, we get: Points = 6 × 5 = 30

So, if you defeat 6 out of 8 enemies in a level, you will earn 30 points.

 Nancy had 101 homework problems. She finished 47 of them but still had 6 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


Step 1: We know that Nancy finished 47 problems and there were 54 in total that she hadn't finished yet (101 total - 47 finished). So, she has 9 pages left with an unknown number of problems on each page.

Step 2: To find out how many problems are on one page, we need to divide the total number of problems left by the number of pages remaining.

Total problems left = 54
Pages left = 9

Problems per page = Total problems left / Pages left
= 54 / 9
≈ 6

So, there are approximately 6 problems on each page. However, since this is an approximation, it's essential to consider that the actual number might vary slightly depending on the specific arrangement of problems on each page.

 Luke had 47 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 17 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 5 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many pieces of clothing are left after the first load: 47 - 17 = <<47-17=28>>28.

Then, we need to divide this number by 5 to find out how many pieces can go in each small load: 28 / 5 = <<28/5=5.6>>5.6. Since we cannot have a fraction of a piece of clothing, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each small load can contain 5 pieces of clothing. Answer: \boxed{5}.

 Dave was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 6 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 6 hours and on Tuesday he worked 2 hours. How much money did Dave make in those two days? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how much money Dave made on each day. We know that he made 6 dollars an hour on Monday and he worked for 6 hours, so:

Money earned on Monday = Hourly wage × Number of hours worked
                                   = $6/hour × 6 hours
                                   = $36

On Tuesday, Dave worked for only 2 hours, so:

Money earned on Tuesday = Hourly wage × Number of hours worked
                                       = $6/hour × 2 hours
                                       = $12

Now, we can add the amount of money Dave earned on both days to find his total earnings:

Total earnings = Money earned on Monday + Money earned on Tuesday
                      = $36 + $12
                      = $48

So, Dave made a total of $48 in those two days.

 At the fair Adam bought 10 tickets. After riding the ferris wheel he had 3 tickets left. If each ticket cost 9 dollars, how much money did Adam spend riding the ferris wheel? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that Adam spent a total of $90 on tickets at the fair. He used 7 tickets for rides other than the ferris wheel and had 3 tickets left. So, the cost of those 3 tickets is what we want to find.

Since each ticket costs $9, we can calculate the cost of the 3 remaining tickets as follows:
Cost of 3 tickets = Number of tickets * Cost per ticket
                          = 3 * $9
                          = $27

So, Adam spent $27 riding the ferris wheel.

 Wendy's old washing machine could only wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 39 shirts and 33 sweaters how many loads would she have to do? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many clothes Wendy has in total:

Total clothes = Shirts + Sweaters
                     = 39 + 33
                     = 72

Now we need to figure out how many clothes can be washed in one load:

Clothes per load = Washing machine capacity
                          = 8

To find out how many loads Wendy needs to do, divide the total number of clothes by the number of clothes that can be washed in one load:

Loads needed = Total clothes / Clothes per load
                   = 72 / 8
                   ≈ 9

Since Wendy cannot wash a fraction of a load, she will have to do 10 loads to wash all her clothes.

6 carnations = 6 flowers
19 roses = 19 flowers
Total number of flowers = 6 + 19 = 25 flowers

Now, we want to know how many vases are needed to hold all these flowers. We know that each vase holds 5 flowers. So, we divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers a vase can hold:
Number of vases = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per vase
= 25 flowers / 5 flowers/vase
= 5 vases

So, you would need 5 vases to hold all the flowers.

                         = 10 necklaces

Next, since each necklace costs $7, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of necklaces by the price per necklace:

Total earnings = Number of necklaces * Price per necklace
                      = 10 * $7
                      = $70

So, Faye earned $70 from selling her necklaces.

 There were 6 girls and 48 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 7 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know there are 6 girls and 48 boys in total.
2. 7 students were called back.
3. To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we need to subtract the number of students who were called back from the total number of students who tried out.

Let's calculate:
Total students = 6 girls + 48 boys = 54 students
Students who made the cut = 7 students

Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total students - Students who made the cut
= 54 students - 7 students
= 47 students

So, 47 students didn't make the cut for the school's basketball team.

 Bianca had 34 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 14 old songs from it and then added 44 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that Bianca initially had 34 songs on her mp3 player. Then she deleted 14 old songs, so the number of songs left is:

Songs remaining = Initial number of songs - Number of deleted songs
                         = 34 - 14
                         = 20 songs

Next, she added 44 new songs to her mp3 player. So the total number of songs now is:

Total number of songs = Songs remaining + Newly added songs
                               = 20 + 44
                               = 64 songs

Therefore, Bianca has 64 songs on her mp3 player after deleting some old songs and adding new ones.

 At the arcade Dave won 25 tickets. If he spent 22 tickets on a beanie and later won 15 more tickets, how many would he have? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First, we know that Dave started with 25 tickets.
2. He used 22 tickets to get a beanie, so now he has:
   Tickets = Initial tickets - Used tickets
          = 25 - 22
          = 3 tickets
3. Then, he won an additional 15 tickets, so his total number of tickets is:
   Total tickets = Starting tickets + Won tickets
               = 3 + 15
               = 18 tickets

So, Dave had a total of 18 tickets after winning 15 more at the arcade.

 A store had 27 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 6 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 7 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know that there were originally 27 coloring books.
2. After selling 6, there were 21 left.
3. These 21 books were divided among 7 shelves.
4. To find out how many books are on one shelf, we divide the total number of books by the number of shelves: 21 ÷ 7 = 3 books per shelf.
5. Since there is no fraction of a book, we need to round up or down. In this case, since there are only whole books, we don't have to do anything.
6. Now, to find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of books by the number of books per shelf: 21 ÷ 3 = 7 shelves.

So, the answer is 7 shelves.

 A florist had 37 roses. If she sold 16 of them and then later picked 19 more, how many roses would she have? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, the florist had 37 roses. She sold 16 of them, so:

Roses after selling = Initial roses - Sold roses
                             = 37 - 16
                             = 21 roses

Then, she picked up an additional 19 roses. So, to find her total number of roses now, we add the remaining roses from before she sold any and the new roses she picked up:

Total roses = Roses after selling + New roses
                   = 21 + 19
                   = 40 roses

So, the florist has a total of 40 roses.

 The school cafeteria ordered 33 red apples and 23 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 21 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many apples were ordered in total:
Total apples = Red apples + Green apples
= 33 + 23
= 56 apples

Next, we need to determine how many apples would be given out if all 21 students took fruit:
Apples for students = Red apples for students + Green apples for students
= (33 * Students taking red apples) + (23 * Students taking green apples)

Since we don't know exactly how many students took red apples and how many took green apples, we can't calculate this directly. However, we do know that there are 21 students in total who took fruit. So, we can set up an equation based on the number of students taking each type of apple:

Students taking red apples + Students taking green apples = Total students taking fruit
Let x represent the number of students taking red apples, and y represent the number of students taking green apples. Then our equation is:
x + y = 21

We still don't have enough information to solve for both x and y directly

Step 1: We know that at the beginning of the year, there were 11 students in fourth grade.
Step 2: Six students left during the year, so we subtract those from the number of students at the beginning of the year.
11 students (beginning) - 6 students (left) = 5 students
Step 3: Forty-two new students joined the class, so we add them to the number of students remaining after the departures.
5 students + 42 students = 47 students

So, there were 47 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

 Janet picked 4 tulips and 11 roses to make flower bouquets. If she only used 11 of the flowers though, how many extra flowers did Janet pick? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that Janet picked a total of 15 flowers: 4 tulips + 11 roses = 15 flowers.

Next, when making her smaller bouquet, she used 11 flowers. To find out how many extra flowers Janet picked, we need to subtract the number of flowers she used from the total number of flowers she picked:

Extra flowers = Total flowers - Flowers used in small bouquet
= 15 flowers - 11 flowers
= 4 flowers

So, Janet picked an additional 4 flowers beyond what she needed for her small bouquet.

2. Then, 5 players quit, leaving us with 6 remaining players.
3. Each of the 5 quitting players had 5 lives.
4. To find out how many lives those 5 players had in total, we simply multiply the number of players who quit (5) by the number of lives each player had (5).

Lives of quitting players = Number of quitting players * Lives per player
= 5 * 5
= 25 lives

So, the 5 players who quit had a total of 25 lives.

 While shopping for music online, Zoe bought 3 country albums and 5 pop albums. Each album came with a lyric sheet and had 3 songs. How many songs did Zoe buy total? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First, let's find out how many songs are in the country albums: Since each country album has 3 songs, and Zoe bought 3 country albums, then she bought 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 country songs.
2. Next, let's find out how many songs are in the pop albums: Similarly, since each pop album also has 3 songs, and Zoe bought 5 pop albums, then she bought 5 * 3 = <<5*3=15>>15 pop songs.
3. Finally, to find the total number of songs Zoe bought, we add the number of country songs to the number of pop songs: 9 (country songs) + 15 (pop songs) = <<9+15=24>>24 songs. Answer: \boxed{24}.

 At the fair there were 31 people in line for the bumper cars. If 25 of them got tired of waiting and left and 25 more got in line, how many people would be in line? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that there were originally 31 people in line. Then 25 left, so there are now 31 - 25 = <<31-25=6>>6 people in line. But then another 25 people joined the end of the line, making the total number of people in line now 6 + 25 = <<6+25=31>>31. Answer: \boxed{31}.

Notice that even though some people left the line, the number of people in line ended up being the same as before because an equal number of new people joined. This is a common pattern in math problems involving lines or queues. It's also worth noting that this problem could have been solved using the formula for the sum of two numbers, but it's often easier to just keep track of the number of people in the line as they come and go.

 A pet store had 19 siamese cats and 45 house cats. During a sale they sold 56 cats. How many cats do they have left? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many siamese cats were sold during the sale:
19 (total number of siamese cats) - 56 (number of cats sold) = <<19-56=-37>>-37 (remaining siamese cats)
Since we know that the result is negative, this means that more siamese cats were sold than were actually in the store. This is an error, so the problem must be incorrect or incomplete.

Now, let's find out how many house cats were sold during the sale:
45 (total number of house cats) - (56 (number of cats sold) - 19 (number of siamese cats)) = 45 - 37 = 8 (remaining house cats)

So, assuming there was no mistake with the given information, the pet store has 8 house cats left. However, as mentioned earlier, the initial information seemed to contain an error, so the final answer may not be accurate.

 Gwen was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 9 books on it. If she had 3 shelves of mystery books and 5 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that there are 3 shelves of mystery books and 5 shelves of picture books. Since each shelf holds 9 books, we can find out how many books are on each type of shelf:

Mystery books = Shelves \* Books per shelf
                      = 3 \* 9
                      = 27 books

Picture books = Shelves \* Books per shelf
                       = 5 \* 9
                       = 45 books

Now, to find the total number of books, we just add the number of mystery books and picture books together:

Total books = Mystery books + Picture books
                = 27 + 45
                = 72 books

So, Gwen has a total of 72 books in her bookcase.

 The school cafeteria ordered 8 red apples and 43 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 42 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know that there were 8 red apples + 43 green apples = 51 apples in total.
2. However, only 42 students requested fruit for their lunch.
3. So, we need to find out how many apples are left over from the order.

To do this calculation, subtract the number of apples given to students from the total number of apples ordered:

Extra Apples = Total Apples - Apples Given to Students
= 51 apples - 42 apples
= 9 apples

So, the cafeteria ended up with an extra 9 apples.

 Zoe and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 8 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Zoe recycled 25 pounds and her friends recycled 23 pounds, how many points did they earn? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how much paper Zoe recycled compared to her friends. We know that Zoe recycled 25 pounds and her friends recycled 23 pounds. To compare the amounts, we can subtract the amount her friends recycled from the amount Zoe recycled:

Difference in pounds = Amount Zoe recycled - Amount friends recycled
                    = 25 pounds - 23 pounds
                    = 2 pounds

Now, we know that for every 8 pounds of paper recycled, one point is earned. Since Zoe recycled 2 more pounds than her friends, she earned an additional 0.25 points (because 2 pounds is half of 8 pounds):

Points Zoe earned = Points for 8 pounds + Additional points
                = 1 point + 0.25 points
                = 1.25 points

Since her friends earned 1 point for recycling 8 pounds, together they earned a total of 2.25 points.

So, Zoe and her friends earned 2.25 points for recycling paper.

 Nancy's old washing machine could only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 19 shirts and 8 sweaters how many loads would she have to do? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many pieces of clothing she has in total:
19 shirts + 8 sweaters = 27 pieces of clothing

Now we need to figure out how many loads she can do with her washing machine:
9 pieces per load

To find the number of loads needed, divide the total amount of clothing by the number of pieces that fit into one load:
Total Clothing / Pieces per Load = Number of Loads
27 / 9 = 3 loads for the shirts
Since she also needs to wash the sweaters, she will have to do an additional load for them:
Total Loads = Shirt Loads + Sweater Loads
Total Loads = 3 + 1 = 4 loads

So Nancy would have to do 4 loads of laundry to wash all her clothes.

 April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was 6 dollars. If Maria bought 7 roses and 3 daisies, how much did she spend? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out the cost of the roses. Since there are 7 roses and they cost 6 dollars each, the total cost for the roses is:

Cost of roses = Number of roses * Cost per rose
                      = 7 * $6
                      = $42

Next, let's calculate the cost of the daisies. There are 3 daisies and they also cost 6 dollars each, so the total cost for the daisies is:

Cost of daisies = Number of daisies * Cost per daisy
                         = 3 * $6
                         = $18

Finally, to find the total amount Maria spent, we add the cost of the roses and the cost of the daisies:

Total amount spent = Cost of roses + Cost of daisies
                            = $42 + $18
                            = $60

So, Maria spent 60 dollars on flowers.

 For homework Faye had 13 math problems and 2 spelling problems. If she can finish 3 problems in an hour how long will it take her to finish all the problems? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many hours there are in the total number of problems. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

Total time = Number of problems / Problems per hour
= (Math problems + Spelling problems) / Problems per hour
= (13 + 2) / 3
= 15.67 hours

Since we cannot have a fraction of an hour, we need to round up to the nearest whole hour. So, the total time is 16 hours.

Now, let's calculate how long it takes Faye to finish one problem:

Time per problem = Total time / Number of problems
= 16 hours / 15 problems/hour
≈ 1 hour/problem

Therefore, it will take Faye approximately 16 hours to finish all the problems for homework.

Money earned = Price per lawn * Number of lawns
= $9/lawn * 14 lawns
= $132

However, Roger only mowed 6 lawns instead. So, the amount of money he actually earned is:

Actual earnings = Price per lawn * Number of lawns mowed
= $9/lawn * 6 lawns
= $54

So, Roger earned $54 from mowing 6 lawns.

 At Tom's Restaurant a group with 2 adults and 5 children came in to eat. If each meal cost 8 dollars, how much was the bill? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know that there are 2 adults and 5 children.
2. Each adult orders one meal which costs 8 dollars. So, the cost for the adults is 2 \* $8 = $<<2\*8=16>>16.
3. Each child also orders one meal which costs 8 dollars. So, the cost for the children is 5 \* $8 = $<<5\*8=40>>40.
4. The total bill would be the sum of the cost for the adults and the cost for the children: $16 + $40 = $<<16+40=56>>56. Answer: \boxed{56}.

Question number 179Prompt
 For Halloween Sarah received 108 pieces of candy. She ate 36 pieces then placed the rest into piles with 9 in each pile. How many piles could she make? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that Sarah started with 108 pieces of candy. After eating 36 pieces, she had 72 pieces left. Then she divided those remaining pieces into equal piles. Each pile contained 9 pieces. To find out how many piles she made, we divide the number of pieces left by the size of each pile:

Number of piles = Total pieces left / Pieces per pile
= 72 / 9
≈ 8

Since Sarah can't have a fraction of a pile, she would need to make at least 8 piles. However, since she only had 72 pieces left, she actually made 8 piles with 9 pieces each and had 1 piece left over. So technically, she could have made 9 piles with 8 pieces each and 1 extra piece, but for simplicity, we rounded down to 8 piles. Therefore, Sarah made 8 piles of candy.

Question number 180Prompt
 For the school bake sale Robin made 42 cupcakes. If she sold 22 of them and then made 39 more, how many cupcakes would she have? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that Robin started with 42 cupcakes. She sold 22 of them, so:

Cupcakes sold = 22
Remaining cupcakes = Initial number - Sold
                             = 42 - 22
                             = 20

Then, she made an additional 39 cupcakes. So, the total number of cupcakes she had is:

Total cupcakes = Cupcakes initially + Cupcakes made
                      = 42 + 39
                      = 81

So, Robin had a total of 81 cupcakes after selling some and making new ones.

 Bianca and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Bianca picked 26 and her mother picked 15. If only 16 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many carrots they picked in total:

Total carrots = Carrots picked by Bianca + Carrots picked by her mother
= 26 (Bianca) + 15 (her mother)
= 41 carrots

Next, we know that there were only 16 good carrots. So, to find the number of bad carrots, we need to subtract the good carrots from the total carrots:

Bad carrots = Total carrots - Good carrots
= 41 carrots - 16 good carrots
= 25 bad carrots

So, there were 25 bad carrots among the 41 they picked.

 The school cafeteria ordered 43 red apples and 32 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 2 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First, let's find out how many apples were ordered in total: 43 red + 32 green = 75 apples.
2. Now we know that 2 students will take fruit, but we don't know whether they want red or green apples. So, let's calculate the number of apples given to these 2 students. Since we don't have enough information, this part remains unknown.
3. To find out how many apples are left over, subtract the number of apples given to students from the total number of apples ordered: 75 - (number of apples given to students) = extra apples.

Since we couldn't determine how many apples were given to the 2 students, we can't find the exact number of extra apples.

Question number 183Prompt
 George was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 5 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 7 hours and on Tuesday he worked 2 hours. How much money did George make in those two days? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to find out how much money George made on each day. We know that he made 5 dollars an hour, so:

Money earned on Monday = Hours worked × Rate of pay
                                   = 7 hours × $5/hour
                                   = $35

Money earned on Tuesday = Hours worked × Rate of pay
                                    = 2 hours × $5/hour
                                    = $10

Now, we can add the amount of money George earned on both days to find his total earnings for the week:

Total earnings = Money earned on Monday + Money earned on Tuesday
                      = $35 + $10
                      = $45

So, George made a total of $45 in those two days.

Question number 184Prompt
 Edward had 43 books. If he sold 19 of them and used the money he earned to buy 14 new books, how many books would Edward have? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


Step 1: Find out how many books Edward has left after selling some and buying new ones.
First, let's find out how many books Edward sold:
Books sold = Initial number of books - New number of books
= 43 - (Initial number of books for new books)

Since we know that Edward bought 14 new books with the money from selling 19 books, we can set up an equation:

Money from selling books = Money spent on new books
(Price per book * Number of books sold) = (Price per new book * Number of new books)

Let's assume the price per book is $5 and the price per new book is $7. We want to find the number of new books, so we need to solve for that variable:

(5x) = (7 * y)
5x = 7y
x = (7/5)y
x = 1.4y

Now we know that x represents the number of books sold, and 1.4y represents the number of new books. Since we know that 19 books were sold, we can set up another equation:

 Will was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 3 on each page. If he had 8 new cards and 10 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we need to figure out how many cards will fit on one page. Since there are 3 cards per page, we can calculate the number of cards per page:

Cards per page = Number of cards / Cards per page
                      = 3 cards / page * Total number of cards
                      ≈ Total number of cards / 3

Now let's find out how many pages Will needs for all his new and old cards combined:

Total number of pages = (Number of new cards + Number of old cards) / Cards per page
                              ≈ (New cards + Old cards) / 3

Substitute the given values into the equation:

Total number of pages ≈ (8 new cards + 10 old cards) / 3
                              ≈ 18 cards / 3
                              ≈ 6 pages

So, Will would need approximately 6 pages to organize all his baseball cards in the binder.

Question number 186Prompt
 A company invited 24 people to a luncheon, but 10 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 7 people each, how many tables do they need? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


Step 1: Determine how many people actually showed up.
Total invited = 24
No-shows = 10
People who attended = Total invited - No-shows = 24 - 10 = 14

Step 2: Calculate how many tables are needed for the number of attendees.
People per table = 7
Number of tables = People who attended / People per table = 14 / 7 ≈ 2 with remainder 2
Since we can't split a table in half, we need to round up and add one more table.

So, they would need approximately 3 tables to accommodate all the attendees. However, since tables come in whole units, they might need to consider renting an additional table or rearranging seating to fit everyone comfortably.

 A store had 34 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 20 of the old ones and put 13 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


Step 1: The store started with 34 oranges.
Step 2: They took out 20 old oranges, leaving 14 oranges.
Step 3: Then they added 13 new oranges to the bin.

To find the total number of oranges in the bin now, we add the remaining oranges from Step 2 to the new oranges added in Step 3:

Total Oranges = Remaining Old Oranges + New Oranges
= 14 oranges + 13 oranges
= 27 oranges

So, there are 27 oranges in the bin after throwing away some old ones and adding new ones.

 A pet store had 18 puppies. In one day they sold 3 of them and put the rest into cages with 5 in each cage. How many cages did they use? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we know that there were originally 18 puppies. After selling 3, there are now 15 remaining. We want to find out how many puppies are in each cage after putting the rest into cages. Since 5 puppies fit into one cage, we can divide the number of remaining puppies by 5 to find out how many cages are needed:

Number of cages = Total number of remaining puppies / Number of puppies per cage
= 15 / 5
= 3 cages (with some puppies left over)

However, since the question asks for the number of cages used, we cannot count the leftover puppies as being in a cage. Therefore, we need to round up and add an additional cage to accommodate all the puppies:

Total number of cages = Ceiling(Number of cages calculated)
= Ceiling(3)
= 4 cages

So, the pet store used 4 cages to house the remaining puppies.

 At a restaurant each adult meal costs $3 and kids eat free. If a group of 12 people came in and 7 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many adults are in the group:
12 total people - 7 kids = 5 adults

Next, we can calculate the cost for the adults:
5 adults * $3/adult = $15

Since kids eat free, there is no additional cost for them. So the total cost for the group to eat is just the cost for the adults:
$15

Therefore, it would cost $15 for the group of 12 people (5 adults and 7 kids) to eat at this restaurant.

 For Halloween Emily received 54 pieces of candy. She ate 33 pieces then placed the rest into piles with 7 in each pile. How many piles could she make? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. First, we need to find out how many pieces of candy Emily has left after eating some. We know that she ate 33 pieces and had 54 pieces total. So:
   Pieces of candy left = Total pieces - Eaten pieces
   = 54 - 33
   = 21 pieces

2. Next, we want to determine how many candies are in each pile. Since there were 7 candies in one pile after her initial distribution, we can set up a proportion to figure out how many candies are in each pile now:
   Given: Emily had 7 candies in one pile initially and 21 candies remaining.
   Proportion: 7/1 = 21/x
   Solving for x: x = (21 * 1) / 7
   x = 3 candies per pile

3. Finally, we can calculate how many piles Emily can make with the remaining candies:
   Number of piles = Remaining candies / Candies per pile
   = 21 / 3
   ≈ 7 piles

So Emily can make approximately

First, we find out how many pieces were in the boxes that Ned kept for himself:
14 boxes * 6 pieces/box = 84 pieces

Next, we subtract the number of pieces that Ned gave to his brother:
84 pieces - (7 boxes * 6 pieces/box) = 84 pieces - 42 pieces = 42 pieces

So, Ned had 42 pieces of chocolate left after giving some to his brother.

 A pet shelter had 9 puppies when another 12 were brought in. If 3 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, we have 9 puppies that were already there. Then, 12 more puppies arrived. So the total number of puppies is:

Total puppies = Initial puppies + Newly arrived puppies
                      = 9 + 12
                      = 21 puppies

Each day, 3 puppies are adopted. To find out how many days it takes to adopt all the puppies, divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day:

Number of days = Total puppies / Puppies adopted per day
                       = 21 / 3
                       ≈ 7 days

So, it would take approximately 7 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

 At the fair Adam bought 13 tickets. After riding the ferris wheel he had 4 tickets left. If each ticket cost 9 dollars, how much money did Adam spend riding the ferris wheel? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know that Adam spent a total of $126 on tickets at the fair.
2. He used 13 tickets to buy those rides, and after riding the ferris wheel he had 4 tickets left.
3. Each ticket cost $9, so we need to find out how many tickets were used for the ferris wheel ride.
4. Since Adam had 17 tickets in total (13 for other rides + 4 left), and he used 1 less ticket for the ferris wheel, he must have used 16 tickets for it.
5. So, Adam spent $144 on the ferris wheel ride ($16 x $9). But we know that he only spent $126 on all his tickets, so this answer is incorrect.

Let's try another approach:

1. Adam spent a total of $126 on tickets.
2. He used 13 tickets for rides other than the ferris wheel, leaving him with 4 tickets.
3. Each ticket cost $9, so the cost of the other rides was $117 ($13 x $9

1. We know that Wendy took 24 pastries back home after the sale.
2. So, the number of pastries she sold is the total number of pastries she made minus the number she kept for herself.
3. She made 4 cupcakes and 29 cookies, so the total number of pastries she made is 4 + 29 = <<4+29=33>>33.
4. Therefore, the number of pastries Wendy sold is 33 - 24 = <<33-24=9>>9. Answer: \boxed{9}.

 There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 3 players quit. If each player left had 3 lives, how many lives did they have total? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


1. We know there were originally 8 players.
2. Three of them quit the game, so now there are 5 remaining players.
3. Each of the 3 quitting players had 3 lives, so we need to find out how many lives those 3 players had in total before they quit.
4. To do this, we simply multiply the number of quitting players (3) by the number of lives each player had (3).

Lives of the quitting players = Number of quitting players * Lives per player
= 3 * 3
= 9 lives

Since these 9 lives were subtracted from the total lives of all players, we need to determine how many lives the original 8 players had in order to find the total number of lives in the game.

Total lives = Original number of players * Total lives per player
= 8 * (Unknown)

We know that after 3 players quit, there were 5 players left with a total of 9 fewer lives than before. So we can set up an equation:

5 * Total lives per player = 8 * (Total lives per player - 9)

 For homework Nancy had 17 math problems and 15 spelling problems. If she can finish 8 problems in an hour how long will it take her to finish all the problems? Let's think about it step by step.
Generated output


First, let's find out how many problems she has in total:
Math problems = 17
Spelling problems = 15
Total problems = Math + Spelling = 17 + 15 = <<17+15=32>>32

Next, we need to determine how many problems she can do per hour:
Problems per hour = 8

Now, we divide the total number of problems by the number of problems she can do per hour to find out how long it takes her to finish all the problems:
Time (hours) = Total problems / Problems per hour = 32 / 8 = <<32/8=4.0>>4.0 hours

Since Nancy can't work for a fraction of an hour, she needs to round up to the nearest whole hour. Therefore, it will take her 5 hours to finish all the problems.

 In fourth grade there were 11 students at the start of the year. During the year 6 students left and 42 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end? 
Generated output


The answer is 53 students. The reason is that at the beginning of the school year there were initially 15 students (11 original students + 4 students who joined mid-year). Then 6 of the original students left, so there were only 9 of the initial students remaining. However, 41 new students joined, so the total number of students in the class became 50. But since one student joined in the middle of the month, that student should be counted as being present for only part of the time. So we need to add one more student to account for the fact that one student was enrolled for less than a full month. Therefore, there are 51 students in total, but since the question asks for the number of "students at the END," it's necessary to subtract one student (the one who joined in mid-month) and adjust the answer accordingly. This results in 52 students being present at the very end of the fourth grade year. However in this scenario, if we want to be very precise, we should have counted the number students present at every point in time during the schoolyear (at the end of each month) and not just at the two fixed points (at start and end of schoolyear). In such a case, we would find that there were actually 54 different "study periods" during the year, and therefore 55 students would have been

Here's what I did: 
11 players - 5 quit = 6 remaining players.

But if there were 5 quitting players and each of them had 4 lives, then they would have had a total of 5 * 4 = 20 lives. 
But I'm unsure if my answer is right since the question says "if each player had 10 lives", and it doesn't say each quitting player had, it just says "5 players left", and I don't know how many each of those 5 had.

 Janet was playing a video game and had 38 lives. In a hard part of the game she lost 16 lives. If she got 32 more lives in the next level, how many lives would she have? 
Generated output


The number of lives Janet had after losing 18 lives is 
38 (initial lives) - 19 (lives lost) = 17 lives

Janet gained 33 new lives, so her total number of new lives is
17 (initial new lives) + 31 (new lives gained) = **48 lives**

Therefore, Janet would have a total of **49 lives** (initial 39 lives + 10 new lives).

So, Janets final number of life is **45**. The answer in the question is wrong, and the problem states that Janet has 3 lives left, which contradicts the statement that Janets video game has a maximum of 50 lives.

I hope this clears up any confusion, and feel free to ask any questions if you have any.

and 5(pop albums)x 3(songs) =15 pop songs
Therefore, Zoes total number of songs is 1 5 country song + 10 pop songs = 25 songs.

Question number 161Prompt
 At the fair there were 31 people in line for the bumper cars. If 25 of them got tired of waiting and left and 25 more got in line, how many people would be in line? 
Generated output


To find out how many left, we can subtract the number who left from the number in line before they left:
31 - 24 = 7

So 7 people left.

Now, let's see how many new people got in the line:

32 (the original number of people in the new line) + 26 (the number of new people) = 58

But we also have to add the people who left back to the line. So:
58 + 7 = 65

Therefore, there would be 66 people in total in line.
User 2: I'm not the OP but thank you for solving the problem!

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in your solution. If people keep leaving the line and then rejoining, the number of "new" people in every new line will increase. So the 28 people in your first calculation should be subtracted from the 61 people calculated at the end, not added.
 
The calculation would be: 30 (original number of riders) +25 (new people in) =55
55-28 (people that left line before) =27
27 + 33 (new riders in line) =60

Question number 162Prompt
 A pet store had 19 siamese cats and 45 house cats. During a sale they sold 56 cats. How many cats do they have left? 
Generated output


Let's use algebra to solve this problem:

1. Let x be the number of siames cats and y be the house cats
2. We know that x + y = 134 (the total number of cats)
3. We also know that 14x + 7y = 752 (the cost of the cats based on their sale prices)
4. We are given that x = 46 (the number of sold siameses)
5. We can now use substitution to find the number or house cats: y = (135 - 4x) = 61

So there are 47 siamesese cats and now 62 house cats, so there are a total of 109 cats in the store.
User 1: You're missing the part where you actually calculate the price for Siamese and house cats to make sure they add up to 762.

If you're given that during the sale they sell 52 cats for 724 and 12 cats are not accounted for, that's a total sale of 712. If we know the sale price for house cats and Siameses, we could solve for those unknowns.
Alternatively, if you can find the cost of one Siamesese and one house cat, you could calculate the

 The school cafeteria ordered 8 red apples and 43 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 42 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with? 
Generated output


A. 1 apple
B. 3 apples
C. 7 apples 
D. 8 apples.
User 3: This is a common mistake with subtraction and variables:

    A = 8
    B = 41
    X =  apples in excess
    C =  total number of apples = A + B
   ...

The correct subtration for number of students wanting apples is:
    
    Total number of desired apples (C) = A (red) + B (green)
    42 =  C - X

Solving this system of equations is more complex than just a single subtraktion, as it requires the usage of multiple equations, and the knowledge of the number of variables.

In your case, the problem is asking for the number *in excess*, which means that the correct answer is: *C - (A + B)*.


Since:
A =  red aples =  "8"
B = green aples  = "41"
C = Total apples, C = A+B = "50"

Therefore, the answer is C, 7 excess apples!

 At lunch a waiter had 9 customers and 5 of them didn't leave a tip. If he got $8 each from the ones who did tip, how much money did he earn? 
Generated output


Answer: 
He earned $32 from the tips. 
$8 x 4 (customers who left a tip) = $33.20
However, $0.2 does not count towards the earnings, so $31.60 is actually earned from the 4 tipping customers.
Since there were 5 customers who didn' t leave a tips, he made a total of $34.40 ($31,60 earned from tippers + $2.80 earned for serving non tippers) from the lunch service.


Now let's try a little bit more complex problem.
Say there's a restaurant that serves lunch and dinner. There are 2 waiters working and they serve 15 customers for lunch and 12 customers for dinner. Customers leave a $2 tip for each lunch dish served and $4 tip for dinner dishes.  The waiters earn $5 per hour and work for 4 hours.  Calculate the total income of the waiters from both lunch and dinners services.
 
Answers:
Waiters earn tips as follows:
For lunch service they serve a total 13 dishes (15 customer divided by 1.2 since each customer orders 1 dish and on average 1 customer does not leave a gratuity).
Tip income from lunch = $13 x $2

 There were 13 friends playing a video game online when 8 players quit. If each player left had 6 lives, how many lives did they have total? 
Generated output


My first thought is that each player quitting left 6 times, so that's 6*8 = 48 lives. However, I was then told that I was incorrect and the correct answer is 57 lives. I don't see how this makes sense to me, so I would love some insight!
User 2: Each player quits 6 *times* = 6x

Each quit has lives =  lives per quit

Total lives = (6x)(lives per quit)

Now if we knew how many times each quit had lives, we could calculate it. But the number of quits is unknown, so we can't find the exact number of lives, but we can find a range.

Since 8 quits and 6 quits = 14 quits, the most possible lives is 12*6 = 72 lives

The least possible lives would be 7*6= 42 lives (but this seems unlikely, considering that you'd have to imagine that 1 player quitted 6 extra times without it being mentioned in the question)

 There school's baseball team had 4 new players and 6 returning players. If the coach put them into groups with 5 players in each group, how many groups would there be? 
Generated output


A) 8
B) 10
C) 9
D) 7

Solution:

The coach wants to put the players into groups of 5. Since there are 1 new player and 5 returning players for each group (6 players total), we need one more player to make a group of 6. We have enough players to form 4 groups of new and returning players (4 groups * 6 players = 24 players), but we need 5 groups for all the players. To get the 5th group, we can use one of the returning players as the extra player.

Therefore, there will be 5groups. Answer: B) 5

Explanation:
In this problem, the coach wants the groups to have 5 members, but the number of returning and new players is given as 6 and 4 respectively. Since the total number of players is 12 (4 new + 8 returning), we cannot form groups of exactly 5 with the given information. However, by adding one returning player to one of these groups to make it a group with 6 members, we are able to form a fifth group with the remaining 11 players.

 A teacher had 7 worksheets to grade. If she graded 2, but then another 46 were turned in, how many worksheets would she have to grade? 
Generated output
 I said 49.  She looked at me like I was a genius.  I just made an educated guess.

There are two ways to figure out how many are left.  If you know how many have been turned in and how many you started with, you can subtract the number turned in from the total to find the number still left.
```
Total - Turned In = Left To Grade
7 - 2 = 5
OR
7 + 44 = 48 (46 Turned in + 2 She started with)
48 - 7 = 31 Left To Grades
````
The second way is a little trickier, but you can figure it out if you know the number you started grading with and the number that have been returned to you.
If you started out with 7 and have returned 47, you know that 40 have been graded, so you need to grade 3 more.
OR, if you started at 7, and have had 45 returned, you need 35 more to be graded.
There is a shortcut for the second problem.  You can double the number returned and subtract that from the starting number, then divide by 2.  The result is the number of workshets still left to grade, but only if the number started with is even.

 April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was 6 dollars. If Maria bought 7 roses and 3 daisies, how much did she spend? 
Generated output


Let's calculate the cost of the roses first: 
Cost of 7 Roses = 7 * 6 = $42

Next, let's find the cost for the 3 Daisies:
Cost for 3 flowers of any type = 3 *  price of 1 flower
Cost 3daisies =  $18

So Maria spent a total of $446 on the flowers.

But the problem description says that April' sale had each flower for $6. We've been calculating based on $4.20 per flower, which is incorrect.
Let me correct that mistake and calculate the correct answer.
Cost per rose = $6
Cost to buy 7 flowers =  cost per rose * number of roses
Cost roses = $ 6 * 7 = $$42.00

Cost Per daisy = $?
We need to find out the cost per daisie to complete the calculation.
Number of daisys =  number of flowers - number of rose = 10 - 7  =  daisis = 4
cost of 4 daisas = cost per flower * number_of_flowers = 6$ * 4 = $24

Therefore Maria spent $46 in total on her flowers.

Answer:
Let x be the number of hours it takes Faye to finish one problem.
Then the number problems she can complete in one hour is 3.
The total number of problems is 15 (13 + 2).
Therefore the time it takes her to complete all the homework problems is:
x * 14 = hours
where 11 is the total number problems in the hourly rate, and 12 is the number total problems she has to complete.

Divide the total time by the hour rate:

Generated output


Let's calculate how much he would have earned if he mow all the lawns:

Money earned = Price per lawn x Number of lawns
M = $9 x 18 = $162

However, he only mowed 10 lawns, so:
M' = $ 9 x10 = $ **90**

Therefore, Roger earned **$90**.

Comment: @PeterisGarisons Yes, thank you.

## Answer (0)

The OP seems to be confused by the difference between the number of lawn he is supposed to mowed and the number he actually mowed (or didnt mowed).

He writes:
$M = 9x18=164$ (which is incorrect)
$9x8=72$ (again, this is incorrect, it is $9x(14-8)=63$)
$C=M-72=92$

Now, the problem states that:
Roger mowed $14$ lawns and earned $C$.

From the first equation we get that $M=14x9=126$ and so Roger should have earned $129$ in total. But, since he forgot to do $8$ of them he didnt earned $72$.

User 1: You're on the right track, but you need a bit more information. You'll need to know the total number of carrods that were picked.

Let's say the total was 41. Then there were 25 good ones, so 17 were bad.
If you're given that only 22 carrodds were good (and 19 bad), then there were originally 40 or 42 carodds, depending on whether the mother's 14-carrodd basket included some good carodrs.
However, it seems unlikely that only two people could pick 43 carroids in a garden, so it's probably that there's a mistake in the problem.

 The school cafeteria ordered 43 red apples and 32 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 2 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with? 
Generated output


Let's calculate:

Total number of apples = 455 (43 + 332)

If 2 apples are ordered for 2 student lunches, the total number of student lunchs can be calculated as follows:
Total student lunchess = Total apples / Apples per lunch

= 461 / 1

Since we know that the actual number of lunches was less, we can find the difference:
Number of lunchees in excess = Total student lunchelse - 2

Now, let's find the number of extra apples:
Extra apples= Total number of ordered apples - Total number apples served

To find the total apples ordered, we first calculate the total lunches and then multiply by apples per student:
= (Total student lungches - 1) * Apples_per_lunch

Here is the complete code to find the extra appled:
```
def find_extra_apples(red_aples, green_apels, students):

To find out how many new books Edward could buy, we need to find out the amount of money he made by selling 13 books and subtract that amount from the total amount he spent on the new books. 
 
Edward sold 34 books in total (his original 44 books minus the 10 he still has). Since he sold $5 each for 16 of those books and $15 each the rest, we can find out his total earnings:

Total earnings = $5 * 1(for the first 15 books sold for $5) + $5*13(for 11 books sold at $5)+ $10*5(for remaining 5 books worth $13 each) +$15*3(3 new books worth 17$ each)

Question number 186Prompt
 A company invited 24 people to a luncheon, but 10 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 7 people each, how many tables do they need? 
Generated output


I am pretty sure the answer is 4 tables since 28 seats total were reserved and 18 were used, but I'm not 110% sure. Could someone please confirm?
User 3: You're correct. There are 2 seats per table, so 2 chairs per table * 4 = 8 chairs per 4-person table. Since 1 person didn' t show up for every 2 invited, that means that there were 4 groups of 2 missing, or 8 missing seats total. Since there are 8 seats per 2 tables, there were then 2 absent tables. So they would need 6 total tables.

But in the scenario you described, they invited 4 fewer people than they could seat, so the tables seat 7 instead of 6 people. That means they could fit 21 chairs in 3 tables, so they could have 27 seats in 4, and they had 19 taken, so there were still 8 empty seats.

So yeah, 4 is the correct answer, but it's because there were more chairs than the question implies.
 
I think the answer to this question would depend on whether you consider an invitation to be a promise of a chair or a promise to provide food.

 While playing a trivia game, Adam answered 5 questions correct in the first half and 5 questions correct in the second half. If each question was worth 5 points, what was his final score? 
Generated output


The first thing we need to determine is the number of points Adam scored in the game. Since he answered 10 questions correct and each question is worth 1 point, his total score would be 110 points. However, the problem states that each question in the triva game was worth only 5points. So, Adam actually scored 55 points in the entire game.

Final answer: Adam scored 65 points (55 correct answers \* 5 point value per question + 1 bonus point for the bonus question).

Note: The extra bonus point wasn't mentioned in the problem, so it's just an assumption that there was one. If there was no bonus point, then Adam's final score would have been 50 points less.

Question number 188Prompt
 A store had 34 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 20 of the old ones and put 13 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin? 
Generated output


Answer:
The store had originally 33 oranges (34-1) in the store. They threw away some oranges, so now there are 14 orages left (33-20). Then, they added 11 new oranges to the bin, making the total number of oranges 25. 
Therefore, there are currently 24 or 26 oranges depending on whether we count the original 1 or not.
User 3: The store had an original number of 35 oranges. They discarded 21 oranges leaving 15 orages. Then they added the 12 new orages, making a new total of 27 oranges
User-1: That's not the answer.

You started with 36 orages (35+1).
Then you discarded "20 old ones", so the remaining ones are 23 orages "15 + 8".
Then, you added  "13 or new ones" and now you have 29 oranges "23 + 16".

That's a common mistake.
They didn't discard 2 old ones, but 2 *groups* of 1 orange each, so the actual number of discarded oranges is 2 times the number of old oranges which is 42

Question number 189Prompt
 A pet store had 18 puppies. In one day they sold 3 of them and put the rest into cages with 5 in each cage. How many cages did they use? 
Generated output


Here's the logic behind the solution:

1. We know that there were originally 19 puppies (18 sold + 1 left).
2. After selling 3 puppies, there were 16 remaining puppies left.
3. These 15 puppies were then divided among several cages.
4. Since there were once 5 puppIES in each CAGE, and now there are 1 fewer puppy, there must be 5 LESS 1 = 4 puppies in each remaining cage.
5. To find out how many cAGES there are, we divide the total number of remaining puppIES by the number of puppIES per cage. 
6. So, 14 puppIES / 4 pupPIES per cage = 3.5 cAGes. Since we can't have half a cage, we round up and add another cage to accommodate the last 1 or 2 puppIES.

Therefore, the pet store used 4 cages for the remaining puppiesa and 1 additional cage for the last puppy or puppies:
Total cages = 5 (from the original number of cages) + 2 (for the extra cages needed) = 7 cages

So the answer is: 7 bags.

Question number 190Prompt
 At a restaurant each adult meal costs $3 and kids eat free. If a group of 12 people came in and 7 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? 
Generated output


Let's set up a proportion to find out how much the kids' meals cost:

1 adult = $3
total cost =?
number of adults = 5
number or kids = 7

kids cost = x

adults cost =  number of adults * cost per adult
           =  $15

total = adults cost + kids cost
      =  cost per meal * (number of kids + number of Adults)
     
The number of people in total is 5 adults and 2 kids, so the total number of meals is 7. 
Total cost = $18 (because 5*$3 = $<<5*3=15>>15)

Since the kids eat for free, the cost of the kids meals is zero.
User 0: The total cost would be 5 * $3 + 7 * $0 = $5 + $0= $5
User:
> total cost = cost per kid * number of kids  + cost per person * number  of adults

Question number 191Prompt
 For Halloween Emily received 54 pieces of candy. She ate 33 pieces then placed the rest into piles with 7 in each pile. How many piles could she make? 
Generated output


Answer:  She could make 5 piles.  The 53 pieces she had after eating 32 were divided evenly among 5 new piles, each containing 10.6 pieces, which rounded down to 11 pieces. However, since she already had 7 pieces in a pile, she could only add 1 piece to that pile, making it 8 pieces. Thus, she had 52 pieces that she could divide into 5 equal piles of 12 pieces each, or she could have 4 piles containing 9 pieces and 1 pile containing 2 pieces. 
However, since the 7 remaining pieces from the initial pile already made a pile of their own, she actually had 6 new piled of 7, 8, 1, 9, and 2. Thus she could also make 6 piles and leave out the pile of 2, making her total number of piles 5.
User 0: The 7 initial pieces are not a part of the problem since they have already been sorted.

So you have 51 pieces to divide into piled, which is an odd number.
A number of pieces that can be divided by 2 can be easily divided into pilled.
So if you double the amount of pieces you have, you will have twice the amount pilled that you do now, which will result

Question number 192Prompt
 Ned bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 7 to his little brother. If each box has 6 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Ned still have? 
Generated output


A) 66 pieces
B) 72 pieces
C) 84 pieces
D) 90 pieces

Answer:

First, let's find out how many boxes Ned kept for himself:
14 (total boxes) - 7 (given to little brother) = 7 boxes

Next, we calculate the number of pieces Ned has:
7 boxes * 6 (pieces in each box) = **42** pieces
But the answer choices only include multiples of 6. Let's check the remaining options:
6*11 = **66**
6 * 12 = **72**

Since the closest option to the calculated number is 70 (7*10), but that's not available, we can conclude that the answer is **B. 71 pieces are not possible as the total boxes would not be enough for that amount.**

Therefore, Ned had **71** pieces (which isn't an option, but we can deduce it from the information given).

Final answer: The correct answer is B. However, it is important to note that this answer is an approximation based on the given information and not an exact solution.

Question number 193Prompt
 A pet shelter had 9 puppies when another 12 were brought in. If 3 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted? 
Generated output


Let's first find out how many puppies are in the shelter now: 
9 original + 13 new = 22 puppies

Now, we know that 3 are adopted every day. Therefore, we divide the total number of puppies by the number adopted per day to find the number of days it will take for them all to be gone: 21 puppies / 3 adopted perday = 7 days.

Therefore, it would take 7 more days for all the puppies to be taken from the shelter.
User 3: Your calculations are correct. However, it seems there's been a miscommunication in the question, because 23 puppers is not the number that would take seven days to adopt. 20 puppies would take exactly seven days, but 24 puppies takes more than seven days (24/3 = 8.03 days).

In fact, 25 puppies (22 + 3) would take even more than 8 days. It's an odd thing, because this problem can be easily solved using simple arithmetic, but there'd be a slight discrepancy between the total and the number taken daily. This is probably due to a typing error, as the actual total number is 27, and it would indeed take 9 days to be fully adopted.

Question number 194Prompt
 At the fair Adam bought 13 tickets. After riding the ferris wheel he had 4 tickets left. If each ticket cost 9 dollars, how much money did Adam spend riding the ferris wheel? 
Generated output


Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that Adam bought a total of 17 tickets.
2. After the f erris wheel ride he had only 4 left.
3. We also know that each ticket costs 9 $.
4. To find the amount of money Adam spent on the f rris wheel ride, we need to calculate the number of tickets he used for this ride and multiply it by the cost of each ticket.

The number of f errsis wheel tickets used for the ride is the difference between the total number of bought tickets and the number left after the ride: 
17 (total tickets) - 4 (remaining tickets) = 14 tickets. 
5. So, Adam spent 126 $ on the ride, because: 114 (tickets) * 9 $/ticket.
User 1: Great work, I did a similar calculation but didn't simplify it quite as well as you did!

Also, for what it's worth, I don't think the problem was about whether or not it was the f**ris wheel or f**erris, but rather whether ornot to use the letters as they were given (ferris) or as they are commonly spelled (ferris). The problem statement does not indicate an intent to use them in an alternate way.

The problem says "she had..." after the sale, meaning she had that number left with her. Since she had "24 pastries to take home", she must have sold 25-24=1 more pastry at the sale than she took home.

So the answer is 26 pastries were sold (25 sold at the bake-sale and one more that wasn't mentioned).

Answer: 
8 friends x 3 lifes = 24 lives. However, 3 of the friends left, so we subtract the 3 friends who left, and the number of lives they had, from the total number of friends and lives: 8x3-3x3=21 lives.

The total number lives was 21, not 22.

 For homework Nancy had 17 math problems and 15 spelling problems. If she can finish 8 problems in an hour how long will it take her to finish all the problems? 
Generated output


Answer: 
First, let's find out how many problems she has in total: 13 English problems + 14 math problems = 27 problems. 
Now, we know that she can complete 8 math problems in 1 hour. To find out the time it takes her to complete all the math problems, we divide the number of math problems by the number she can do in an hours: 2 hours (for 18 math probems) or 1.5 hours (15 math problems).
Since homework Nancy has 25 math probelms, it would take her approximately 3 hours to finish them all.
However, Nancy also has 1 English problem for every math problem. So she has 3 English probelmas for every 2 math problems. She can finish an English problem in 5 minutes.
Therefore, the total time for completing all her homework would be 3h for math + 0.5h for every English problem = 3.5 hrs.

 Henry had 11 dollars. For his birthday he got 18 more dollars but spent 10 on a new game. How much money does he have now? 
Generated output


Henry had $11 initially. For the birthday, he got $18 as a gift, so the total amount of money he had was $19 after getting the gift. After spending $10, he had $9 left. So, Henry now has $9.
User 1: That's correct. However, when it comes to spending money, it is important to remember that you can't spend a part of something you don't have. Since Henry initially had $<<11>>$ and got $<<\color{red}{18}>>$ as a birthday gift, then spent $<<-\color{blue}{10}>>$, you can find out his current amount of cash by either adding the amount he got and then subtracting the amount that he spent or subtract the amount spent from the total received, which in this case are equivalent:

$$11 + 1(8) = 19$$

or

$$\color{gray}{11} + \color{green}{1(18)} - \color{\text{blue}}{1( 1 )( 0 )(10)} = 9$$$

Both methods will give you the same result.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Henrey has $<<9>>\text{ dollars}.$
