Answer:

Explanation:
The text states "I took the water bottle out of the backpack," which indicates that the speaker (I) performed an action on two objects: taking and the water bottle, and the water bottle and the backpack. Since the question asks for the object that the speaker acted upon when using the word "so that," the answer must be the second object mentioned in the sentence, which is the backpack. Therefore, the answer is B.
